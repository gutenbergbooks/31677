<h2>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p>The first and the last of these Studies relate to
persons whose fame has gone out into all lands, and
about whom so much remains to be said that one
who has reflected on their careers need not offer
an apology for saying something. Of the other
eighteen sketches, some deal with eminent men
whose names are still familiar, but whose personalities
have begun to fade from the minds of the
present generation. The rest treat of persons
who came less before the public, but whose
brilliant gifts and solid services to the world
make them equally deserve to be remembered
with honour. Having been privileged to enjoy
their friendship, I have felt it a duty to do what
a friend can to present a faithful record of their
excellence which may help to keep their memory
fresh and green.</p>
<p>These Studies are, however, not to be regarded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_viii' name='page_viii'></a>viii</span>
as biographies, even in miniature. My aim
has rather been to analyse the character and
powers of each of the persons described, and,
as far as possible, to convey the impression
which each made in the daily converse of life.
All of them, except Lord Beaconsfield, were
personally, and most of them intimately, known
to me.</p>
<p>In the six Studies which treat of politicians
I have sought to set aside political predilections,
and have refrained from expressing political
opinions, though it has now and then been
necessary to point out instances in which the
subsequent course of events has shown the
action of Lord Beaconsfield, Mr. Lowe, and
Mr. Gladstone to have been right or wrong (as
the case may be) in the action they respectively
took.</p>
<p>The sketches of T. H. Green, E. A. Freeman,
and J. R. Green were originally written
for English magazines, and most of the other
Studies have been published in the United
States. All of those that had already appeared
in print have been enlarged and revised, some
indeed virtually rewritten. I have to thank the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_ix' name='page_ix'></a>ix</span>
proprietors of the <i>English Historical Review</i>,
the <i>Contemporary Review</i>, and the <i>New York
Nation</i>, as also the Century Company of New
York, for their permission to use so much of
the matter of the volume as had appeared (in
its original form) in the organs belonging to
them respectively.</p>

<h2>BENJAMIN DISRAELI, EARL OF BEACONSFIELD<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor2">[1]</a></h2>
</div>
<p>When Lord Beaconsfield died in 1881 we all
wondered what people would think of him fifty
years thereafter. Divided as our own judgments
were, we asked whether he would still seem a
problem. Would opposite views regarding his
aims, his ideas, the sources of his power, still
divide the learned, and perplex the ordinary
reader? Would men complain that history cannot
be good for much when, with the abundant
materials at her disposal, she had not framed a
consistent theory of one who played so great a
part in so ample a theatre? People called him
a riddle; and he certainly affected a sphinx-like
attitude. Would the riddle be easier then than
it was for us, from among whom the man had
even now departed?</p>
<p>When he died, there were many in England
who revered him as a profound thinker and a
lofty character, animated by sincere patriotism.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
Others, probably as numerous, held him for no
better than a cynical charlatan, bent through
life on his own advancement, who permitted no
sense of public duty, and very little human
compassion, to stand in the way of his insatiate
ambition. The rest did not know what to think.
They felt in him the presence of power; they
felt also something repellent. They could not
understand how a man who seemed hard and
unscrupulous could win so much attachment and
command so much obedience.</p>
<p>Since Disraeli departed nearly one-half of
those fifty years has passed away. Few are
living who can claim to have been his personal
friends, none who were personal enemies. No
living statesman professes to be his political
disciple. The time has come when one may discuss
his character and estimate his career without
being suspected of doing so with a party bias
or from a party motive. Doubtless those who
condemn and those who defend or excuse some
momentous parts of his conduct, such as, for
instance, his policy in the East and in Afghanistan
from 1876 to 1879, will differ in their
judgment of his wisdom and foresight. If this
be a difficulty, it is an unavoidable one, and
may never quite disappear. There were in the
days of Augustus some who blamed that sagacious
ruler for seeking to check the expansion of the
Roman Empire. There were in the days of King
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
Henry the Second some who censured and others
who praised him for issuing the Constitutions of
Clarendon. Both questions still remain open to
argument; and the conclusion any one forms
must affect in some measure his judgment of
each monarch&rsquo;s statesmanship. So differences of
opinion about particular parts of Disraeli&rsquo;s long
career need not prevent us from dispassionately
inquiring what were the causes that enabled him
to attain so striking a success, and what is the
place which posterity is likely to assign to him
among the rulers of England.</p>
<p>First, a few words about the salient events of
his life, not by way of writing a biography, but
to explain what follows.</p>
<p>He was born in London, in 1804. His father,
Isaac Disraeli, was a literary man of cultivated
taste and independent means, who wrote a good
many books, the best known of which is his
<i>Curiosities of Literature</i>, a rambling work, full
of entertaining matter. He belonged to that
division of the Jewish race which is called
the Sephardim, and traces itself to Spain and
Portugal;<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> but he had ceased to frequent the
synagogue&mdash;had, in fact, broken with his co-religionists.
Isaac had access to good society, so
that the boy saw eminent and polished men from
his early years, and, before he had reached manhood,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
began to make his way in drawing-rooms
where he met the wittiest and best-known people
of the day. He was articled to a firm of attorneys
in London in 1821, but after two or three
years quitted a sphere for which his peculiar gifts
were ill suited.<a name='FNanchor_0002' id='FNanchor_0002'></a><a href='#Footnote_0002' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> Samuel Rogers, the poet, took
a fancy to him, and had him baptized at the age
of thirteen. As he grew up, he was often to be
seen with Count d&rsquo;Orsay and Lady Blessington,
well-known figures who fluttered on the confines
of fashion and Bohemia. It is worth remarking
that he never went either to a public school or to
a university. In England it has become the
fashion to assume that nearly all the persons who
have shone in public life have been educated in one
of the great public schools, and that they owe to
its training their power of dealing with men and
assemblies. Such a superstition is sufficiently
refuted by the examples of men like Pitt,
Macaulay, Bishop Wilberforce, Disraeli, Cobden,
Bright, and Cecil Rhodes, not to add instances
drawn from Ireland and Scotland, where till very
recently there have been no public schools in the
current English sense.</p>
<p>Disraeli first appeared before the public in
1826, when he published <i>Vivian Grey</i>, an amazing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
book to be the production of a youth of twenty-two.
Other novels&mdash;<i>The Young Duke</i>, <i>Venetia</i>,
<i>Contarini Fleming</i>, <i>Henrietta Temple</i>&mdash;maintained
without greatly increasing his reputation
between 1831 and 1837. Then came two
political stories, <i>Coningsby</i> and <i>Sybil</i>, in 1844
and 1845, followed by <i>Tancred</i> in 1847, and the
<i>Life of Lord George Bentinck</i> in 1852; with a
long interval of silence, till, in 1870, he produced
<i>Lothair</i>, in 1880 <i>Endymion</i>. Besides these he
published in 1839 the tragedy of <i>Alarcos</i>, and in
1835 the more ambitious <i>Revolutionary Epick</i>,
neither of which had much success. In 1828-31
he took a journey through the East, visiting
Constantinople, Syria, and Egypt, and it was
then, no doubt, in lands peculiarly interesting to
a man of his race, that he conceived those ideas
about the East and its mysterious influences
which figure largely in some of his stories,
notably in <i>Tancred</i>, and which in 1878 had no
small share in shaping his policy and that of
England. Meanwhile, he had not forgotten the
political aspirations which we see in <i>Vivian Grey</i>.
In 1832, just before the passing of the Reform
Bill, he appeared as candidate for the petty
borough of High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire,
and was defeated by a majority of twenty-three
to twelve, so few were the voters in many
boroughs of those days. After the Bill had
enlarged the constituency, he tried his luck twice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
again, in 1833 and 1835, both times unsuccessfully,
and came before two other boroughs also,
Taunton and Marylebone, though in the latter
case no contest took place. Such activity in a
youth with little backing from friends and comparatively
slender means marked him already as
a man of spirit and ambition. His next attempt
was more lucky. At the general election of 1837
he was returned for Maidstone.</p>
<p>His political professions during this period
have been keenly canvassed; nor is it easy to
form a fair judgment on them. In 1832 he
had sought and obtained recommendations from
Joseph Hume and Daniel O&rsquo;Connell, and people
had therefore set him down as a Radical. Although,
however, his professions of political
faith included dogmas which, like triennial parliaments,
the ballot, and the imposition of a new
land-tax, were part of the so-called &ldquo;Radical&rdquo;
platform, still there was a vague and fanciful
note in his utterances, and an aversion to the
conventional Whig way of putting things, which
showed that he was not a thorough-going
adherent of any of the then existing political
parties, but was trying to strike out a new line
and attract men by the promise of something
fresher and bolder than the recognised schools
offered. In 1834 his hostility to Whiggism
was becoming more pronounced, and a tenderness
for some Tory doctrines more discernible.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
Finally, in 1835, he appeared as an avowed
Tory, accepting the regular creed of the party,
and declaring himself a follower of Sir Robert
Peel, but still putting forward a number of
views peculiar to himself, which he thereafter
developed not only in his speeches but in his
novels. <i>Coningsby</i> and <i>Sybil</i> were meant to be
a kind of manifesto of the &ldquo;Young England&rdquo;
party&mdash;a party which can hardly be said to have
existed outside his own mind, though a small knot
of aristocratic youths who caught up and repeated
his phrases seemed to form a nucleus for it.</p>
<p>The fair conclusion from his deliverances
during these early years is that he was at first
much more of a Liberal than a Tory, yet with
ideas distinctively his own which made him appear
in a manner independent of both parties. The
old party lines might seem to have been almost
effaced by the struggle over the Reform Bill;
and it was natural for a bold and inventive mind
to imagine a new departure, and put forward a
programme in which a sort of Radicalism was
mingled with doctrines of a different type. But
when it became clear after a time that the old
political divisions still subsisted, and that such a
distinctive position as he had conceived could not
be maintained, he then, having to choose between
one or other of the two recognised parties, chose
the Tories, dropping some tenets he had previously
advocated which were inconsistent with their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
creed, but retaining much of his peculiar way
of looking at political questions. How far the
change which passed over him was a natural
development, how far due to mere calculations of
interest, there is little use discussing: perhaps he
did not quite know himself. Looking back, we
of to-day might be inclined to think that he received
more blame for it than he deserved, but
contemporary observers generally set it down to a
want of principle. In one thing, however, he was
consistent then, and remained consistent ever after&mdash;his
hearty hatred of the Whigs. There was
something in the dryness and coldness of the great
Whig families, their stiff constitutionalism, their
belief in political economy, perhaps also their
occasional toyings with the Nonconformists
(always an object of dislike to Disraeli), which
roused all the antagonisms of his nature, personal
and Oriental.</p>
<p>When he entered the House of Commons he
was already well known to fashionable London,
partly by his striking face and his powers of conversation,
partly by the eccentricities of his dress&mdash;he
loved bright-coloured waistcoats, and decked
himself with rings,&mdash;partly by his novels, whose
satirical pungency had made a noise in society.
He had also become, owing to his apparent change
of front, the object of angry criticism. A quarrel
with Daniel O&rsquo;Connell, in the course of which he
challenged the great Irishman to fight a duel, each
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
party having described the other with a freedom
of language bordering on scurrility, made him, for
a time, the talk of the political world. Thus
there was more curiosity evoked by his first
speech than usually awaits a new member. It
was unsuccessful, not from want of ability, but
because its tone did not suit the temper of
the House of Commons, and because a hostile
section of the audience sought to disconcert him
by their laughter. Undeterred by this ridicule,
he continued to speak, though in a less
ambitious and less artificial vein, till after a few
years he had become one of the most conspicuous
unofficial members. At first no one had eulogised
Peel more warmly, but after a time he
edged away from the minister, whether repelled
by his coldness, which showed that in that
quarter no promotion was to be expected, or
shrewdly perceiving that Peel was taking a line
which would ultimately separate him from the
bulk of the Conservative party. This happened
in 1846, when Peel, convinced that the import
duties on corn were economically unsound, proposed
their abolition. Disraeli, who, since 1843,
had taken repeated opportunities of firing stray
shots at the powerful Prime Minister, now bore a
foremost part not only in attacking him, but in
organising the Protectionist party, and prompting
its leader, Lord George Bentinck. In embracing
free trade, Peel carried with him his own personal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
friends and disciples, men like Gladstone, Sidney
Herbert, Lord Lincoln, Sir James Graham, Cardwell,
and a good many others, the intellectual <i>&eacute;lite</i>
of the Tory party. The more numerous section
who clung to Protection had numbers, wealth,
respectability, cohesion, but brains and tongues
were scarce. An adroit tactician and incisive
speaker was of priceless value to them. Such
a man they found in Disraeli, while he gained,
sooner than he had expected, an opportunity of
playing a leading part in the eyes of Parliament
and the country. In the end of 1848, Lord
George Bentinck, who, though a man of natural
force and capable of industry when he pleased,
had been to some extent Disraeli&rsquo;s mouthpiece,
died, leaving his prompter indisputably the keenest
intellect in the Tory-Protectionist party. In 1850,
Peel, who might possibly have in time brought
the bulk of that party back to its allegiance
to him, was killed by a fall from his horse.
The Peelites drifted more and more towards
Liberalism, so that when Lord Derby, who, in
1851, had been commissioned as head of the
Tory party to form a ministry, invited them to
join him, they refused to do so, imagining him
to be still in favour of the corn duties, and
resenting the behaviour of the Protectionist
section to their own master. Being thus unable
to find one of them to lead his followers in
the House of Commons, Lord Derby turned in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
1852 to Disraeli, giving him, with the leadership,
the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer. The
appointment was thought a strange one, because
Disraeli brought to it absolutely no knowledge
of finance and no official experience. He had
never been so much as an Under-Secretary.
The Tories themselves murmured that one whom
they regarded as an adventurer should be raised
to so high a place. After a few months Lord
Derby&rsquo;s ministry fell, defeated on the Chancellor
of the Exchequer&rsquo;s Budget, which had been
vehemently attacked by Mr. Gladstone. This
was the beginning of that protracted duel between
him and Mr. Disraeli which lasted down till the
end of the latter&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>For the following fourteen years Disraeli&rsquo;s
occupation was that of a leader of Opposition,
varied by one brief interval of office in 1858-59.
His party was in a permanent minority, so that
nothing was left for its chief but to fight with
skill, courage, and resolution a series of losing
battles. This he did with admirable tenacity of
purpose. Once or twice in every session he used
to rally his forces for a general engagement, and
though always defeated, he never suffered himself
to be dispirited by defeat. During the rest of the
time he was keenly watchful, exposing all the mistakes
in domestic affairs of the successive Liberal
Governments, and when complications arose in
foreign politics, always professing, and generally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
manifesting, a patriotic desire not to embarrass
the Executive, lest national interests should suffer.
Through all these years he had to struggle, not
only with a hostile majority in office, but also
with disaffection among his own followers. Many
of the landed aristocracy could not bring themselves
to acquiesce in the leadership of a new
man, of foreign origin, whose career had been
erratic, and whose ideas they found it hard to
assimilate. Ascribing their long exclusion from
power to his presence, they more than once
conspired to dethrone him. In 1861 these plots
were thickest, and Disraeli was for a time left
almost alone. But as it happened, there never
arose in the House of Commons any one on the
Conservative side possessing gifts of speech and
of strategy comparable to those which in him
had been matured and polished by long experience,
while he had the address to acquire
an ascendency over the mind of Lord Derby,
still the titular head of the party, who, being
a man of straightforward character, high social
position, and brilliant oratorical talent, was therewithal
somewhat lazy and superficial, and therefore
disposed to lean on his lieutenant in the
Lower House, and to borrow from him those
astute schemes of policy which Disraeli was fertile
in devising. Thus, through Lord Derby&rsquo;s support,
and by his own imperturbable confidence, he frustrated
all the plots of the malcontent Tories.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
New men came up who had not witnessed his
earlier escapades, but knew him only as the bold
and skilful leader of their party in the House of
Commons. He made himself personally agreeable
to them, encouraged them in their first
efforts, diffused his ideas among them, stimulated
the local organisation of the party, and held out
hopes of great things to be done when fortune
should at last revisit the Tory banner.</p>
<p>While Lord Palmerston lived, these exertions
seemed to bear little fruit. That minister had, in
his later years, settled down into a sort of practical
Toryism, and both parties acquiesced in his
rule. But, on his death, the scene changed.
Lord Russell and Mr. Gladstone brought forward
a Reform Bill strong enough to evoke the latent
Conservative feeling of a House of Commons
which, though showing a nominally Liberal
majority, had been chosen under Palmerstonian
auspices. The defeat of the Bill, due to the defection
of the more timorous Whigs, was followed
by the resignation of Lord Russell&rsquo;s Ministry.
Lord Derby and Mr. Disraeli came into power,
and, next year, carried a Reform Bill which, as it
was finally shaped in its passage through the House,
really went further than Lord Russell&rsquo;s had done,
enfranchising a much larger number of the working
classes in boroughs. To have carried this Bill
remains the greatest of Disraeli&rsquo;s triumphs. He
had to push it gently through a hostile House of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
Commons by wheedling a section of the Liberal
majority, against the appeals of their legitimate
leader. He had also to persuade his own followers
to support a measure which they had all their lives
been condemning, and which was, or in their view
ought to have been, more dangerous to the Constitution
than the one which they and the recalcitrant
Whigs had thrown out in the preceding
year. He had, as he happily and audaciously
expressed it, to educate his party into doing the
very thing which they (though certainly not he
himself) had cordially and consistently denounced.</p>
<p>The process was scarcely complete when the
retirement of Lord Derby, whose health had given
way, opened Disraeli&rsquo;s path to the post of first
Minister of the Crown. He dissolved Parliament,
expecting to receive a majority from the gratitude
of the working class whom his Act had admitted
to the suffrage. To his own surprise, and to the
boundless disgust of the Tories, a Liberal House
of Commons was again returned, which drove him
and his friends once more into the cold shade of
Opposition. He was now sixty-four years of age,
had suffered an unexpected and mortifying discomfiture,
and had no longer the great name of
Lord Derby to cover him. Disaffected voices
were again heard among his own party, while the
Liberals, reinstalled in power, were led by the
rival whose unequalled popularity in the country
made him for the time omnipotent. Still Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
Disraeli was not disheartened. He fought the
battle of apparently hopeless resistance with his
old tact, wariness, and tenacity, losing no occasion
for any criticism that could damage the measures&mdash;strong
and large measures&mdash;which Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
Government brought forward.</p>
<p>Before long the tide turned. The Dissenters
resented the Education Act of 1870. A reaction
in favour of Conservatism set in, which grew
so fast that, in 1874, the general election gave, for
the first time since 1846, a decided Conservative
majority. Mr. Disraeli became again Prime
Minister, and now a Prime Minister no longer
on sufferance, but with the absolute command of
a dominant party, rising so much above the rest
of the Cabinet as to appear the sole author of its
policy. In 1876, feeling the weight of age, he
transferred himself to the House of Lords as
Earl of Beaconsfield. The policy he followed
(from 1876 till 1880) in the troubles which arose
in the Turkish East out of the insurrection in
Herzegovina and the massacres in Bulgaria, as
well as that subsequently pursued in Afghanistan
and in South Africa, while it received the enthusiastic
approval of the soldiers, the stockbrokers,
and the richer classes generally, raised no less
vehement opposition in other sections of the
nation, and especially in those two which, when
heartily united and excited, have usually been
masters of England&mdash;the Protestant Nonconformists
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
and the upper part of the working class.
An election fought with unusual heat left him in
so decided a minority that he resigned office in
April 1880, without waiting for an adverse vote
in Parliament. When the result had become
clear he observed, &ldquo;They,&rdquo; meaning his friends,
&ldquo;will come in again, but I shall not.&rdquo; A year
later he died.</p>
<p>Here is a wonderful career, not less wonderful
to those who live in the midst of English
politics and society than it appears to observers
in other countries. A man with few external
advantages, not even that of education at a
university, where useful friendships are formed,
with grave positive disadvantages in his Jewish
extraction and the vagaries of his first years of
public life, presses forward, step by step, through
slights and disappointments which retard but never
dishearten him, assumes as of right the leadership
of a party&mdash;the aristocratic party, the party in those
days peculiarly suspicious of new men and poor
men,&mdash;wins a reputation for sagacity which makes
his early errors forgotten, becomes in old age the
favourite of a court, the master of a great country,
one of the three or four arbiters of Europe.
There is here more than one problem to solve,
or, at least, a problem with more than one aspect.
What was the true character of the man who had
sustained such a part? Did he hold any principles,
or was he merely playing with them as counters?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
By what gifts or arts did he win such a success?
Was there really a mystery beneath the wizard&rsquo;s
robe which he delighted to wrap around him?
And how, being so unlike the Englishmen among
whom his lot was cast, did he so fascinate and
rule them?</p>
<p>Imagine a man of strong will and brilliant
intellectual powers, belonging to an ancient and
persecuted race, who finds himself born in a
foreign country, amid a people for whose ideas
and habits he has no sympathy and scant
respect. Suppose him proud, ambitious, self-confident&mdash;too
ambitious to rest content in a
private station, so self-confident as to believe that
he can win whatever he aspires to. To achieve
success, he must bend his pride, must use the
language and humour the prejudices of those he
has to deal with; while his pride avenges itself
by silent scorn or thinly disguised irony. Accustomed
to observe things from without, he discerns
the weak points of all political parties, the hollowness
of institutions and watchwords, the instability
of popular passion. If his imagination be more
susceptible than his emotions, his intellect more
active than his conscience, the isolation in which
he stands and the superior insight it affords him
may render him cold, calculating, self-centred.
The sentiment of personal honour may remain,
because his pride will support it; and he will be
tenacious of the ideas which he has struck out,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
because they are his own. But for ordinary
principles of conduct he may have small regard,
because he has not grown up under the conventional
morality of the time and nation, but has
looked on it merely as a phenomenon to be
recognised and reckoned with, because he has
noted how much there is in it of unreality or
pharisaism&mdash;how far it sometimes is from representing
or expressing either the higher judgments
of philosophy or the higher precepts of religion.
Realising and perhaps exaggerating the power
of his own intelligence, he will secretly revolve
schemes of ambition wherein genius, uncontrolled
by fears or by conscience, makes all
things bend to its purposes, till the scruples and
hesitations of common humanity seem to him
only parts of men&rsquo;s cowardice or stupidity. What
success he will win when he comes to carry out
such schemes in practice will largely depend on
the circumstances in which he finds himself, as
well as on his gift for judging of them. He may
become a Napoleon. He may fall in a premature
collision with forces which want of sympathy has
prevented him from estimating.</p>
<p>In some of his novels, and most fully in the
first of them, Mr. Disraeli sketched a character
and foreshadowed a career not altogether unlike
that which has just been indicated. It would be
unfair to treat as autobiographical, though some
of his critics have done so, the picture of Vivian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
Grey. What that singular book shows is that,
at an age when his contemporaries were lads at
college, absorbed in cricket matches or Latin
verse-making, Disraeli had already meditated
profoundly on the conditions and methods of
worldly success, had rejected the allurements of
pleasure and the attractions of literature, as well
as the ideal life of philosophy, had conceived of
a character isolated, ambitious, intense, resolute,
untrammelled by scruples, who moulds men to
his purposes by the sheer force of his intellect,
humouring their foibles, using their weaknesses,
and luring them into his chosen path by the bait
of self-interest.</p>
<p>To lay stress on the fact that Mr. Disraeli
was of Hebrew birth is not, though some of his
political antagonists stooped so to use it, to cast
any reproach upon him: it is only to note a fact
of the utmost importance for a proper comprehension
of his position. The Jews were at the
beginning of the nineteenth century still foreigners
in England, not only on account of their religion,
with its mass of ancient rites and usages, but also
because they were filled with the memory of
centuries of persecution, and perceived that in
some parts of Europe the old spirit of hatred had
not died out. The antiquity of their race, their
sense of its long-suffering and isolation, their
pride in the intellectual achievements of those
ancestors whose blood, not largely mixed with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
that of any other race, flows in their veins, lead
the stronger or more reflective spirits to revenge
themselves by a kind of scorn upon the upstart
Western peoples among whom their lot is cast.
The mockery one finds in Heinrich Heine could
not have come from a Teuton. Even while imitating,
as the wealthier of them have latterly begun
to imitate, the manners and luxury of those
nominal Christians among whom they live, they
retain their feeling of detachment, and are apt
to regard with a coldly observant curiosity the
beliefs, prejudices, enthusiasms of the nations of
Europe. The same passionate intensity which
makes the grandeur of the ancient Hebrew
literature still lives among them, though often
narrowed by ages of oppression, and gives them
the peculiar effectiveness that comes from turning
all the powers of the mind, imaginative as well as
reasoning, into a single channel, be that channel
what it may. They produce, in proportion to
their numbers, an unusually large number of able
and successful men, as any one may prove by
recounting the eminent Jews of the last seventy
years. This success has most often been won in
practical life, in commerce, or at the bar, or in
the press (which over the European continent
they so largely control); yet often also in the
higher walks of literature or science, less frequently
in art, most frequently in music.</p>
<p>Mr. Disraeli had three of these characteristics
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
of his race in full measure&mdash;detachment, intensity,
the passion for material success. Nature gave
him a resolute will, a keen and precociously active
intellect, a vehement individuality; that is to
say, a consciousness of his own powers, and a
determination to make them recognised by his
fellows. In some men, the passion to succeed is
clogged by the fear of failure; in others, the
sense of their greatness is self-sufficing and
indisposes them to effort. But with him ambition
spurred self-confidence, and self-confidence
justified ambition. He grew up in a cultivated
home, familiar not only with books but with the
brightest and most polished men and women of
the day, whose conversation sharpened his wits
almost from childhood. No religious influences
worked upon him, for his father had ceased to
be a Jew in faith without becoming even
nominally a Christian, and there is little in his
writings to show that he had ever felt anything
more than an imaginative, or what may be called an
historical, interest in religion.<a name='FNanchor_0003' id='FNanchor_0003'></a><a href='#Footnote_0003' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> Thus his development
was purely intellectual. The society he moved
in was a society of men and women of the world&mdash;witty,
superficial in its interests, without seriousness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
or reverence. He felt himself no Englishman,
and watched English life and politics as a
student of natural history might watch the habits
of bees or ants. English society was then, and
perhaps is still, more complex, more full of inconsistencies,
of contrasts between theory and
practice, between appearances and realities, than
that of any other country. Nowhere so much
limitation of view among the fashionable, so much
pharisaism among the respectable, so much vulgarity
among the rich, mixed with so much real
earnestness, benevolence, and good sense; nowhere,
therefore, so much to seem merely ridiculous to
one who looked at it from without, wanting the
sympathy which comes from the love of mankind,
or even from the love of one&rsquo;s country. It was
natural for a young man with Disraeli&rsquo;s gifts to
mock at what he saw. But he would not sit
still in mere contempt. The thirst for power
and fame gave him no rest. He must gain what
he saw every one around him struggling for.
He must triumph over these people whose follies
amused him; and the sense that he perceived
and could use their follies would add zest to
his triumph. He might have been a great
satirist; he resolved to become a great statesman.
For such a career, his Hebrew detachment gave
him some eminent advantages. It enabled him
to take a cooler and more scientific view of the
social and political phenomena he had to deal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
with. He was not led astray by party cries.
He did not share vulgar prejudices. He calculated
the forces at work as an engineer calculates
the strength of his materials, the strain they have
to bear from the wind, and the weights they
must support. And what he had to plan was
not the success of a cause, which might depend
on a thousand things out of his ken, but his own
success, a simpler matter.</p>
<p>A still greater source of strength lay in his
Hebrew intensity. It would have pleased him,
so full of pride in the pure blood of his race,<a name='FNanchor_0004' id='FNanchor_0004'></a><a href='#Footnote_0004' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a>
to attribute to that purity the singular power
of concentration which the Jews undoubtedly
possess. They have the faculty of throwing the
whole stress of their natures into the pursuit of
one object, fixing their eyes on it alone, sacrificing
to it other desires, clinging to it even when
it seems unattainable. Disraeli was only twenty-eight
when he made his first attempt to enter
the House of Commons. Four repulses did
not discourage him, though his means were but
scanty to support such contests; and the fifth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
time he succeeded. When his first speech in
Parliament had been received with laughter, and
politicians were congratulating themselves that
this adventurer had found his level, he calmly
told them that he had always ended by succeeding
in whatever he attempted, and that
he would succeed in this too. He received no
help from his own side, who regarded him with
suspicion, but forced himself into prominence,
and at last to leadership, by his complete superiority
to rebuffs. Through the long years in
which he had to make head against a majority
in the House of Commons, he never seemed
disheartened by his repeated defeats, never relaxed
the vigilance with which he watched his
adversaries, never indulged himself (though he
was physically indolent and often in poor health)
by staying away from Parliament, even when
business was slack; never missed an opportunity
for exposing a blunder of his adversaries, or
commending the good service of one of his
own followers. The same curious tenacity was
apparent in his ideas. Before he was twenty-two
years of age he had, under the inspiration
of Bolingbroke, excogitated a theory of the
Constitution of England, of the way England
should be governed at home and her policy
directed abroad, from which he hardly swerved
through all his later life. Often as he was
accused of inconsistency, he probably believed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
himself to be, and in a sense he was, substantially
faithful, I will not say to the same
doctrines, but to the same notions or tendencies;
and one could discover from the phrases he employed
how he fancied himself to be really following
out these old notions, even when his conduct
seemed opposed to the traditions of his party.<a name='FNanchor_0005' id='FNanchor_0005'></a><a href='#Footnote_0005' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a>
The weakness of intense minds is their tendency
to narrowness, and this weakness was in so far
his that, while always ready for new expedients,
he was not accessible to new ideas. Indeed,
the old ideas were too much a part of himself,
stamped with his own individuality, to be forsaken
or even varied. He did not love knowledge, nor
enjoy speculation for its own sake; he valued
views as they pleased his imagination or as they
carried practical results with them; and having
framed his theory once for all and worked steadily
upon its lines, he was not the man to admit that
it had been defective, and to set himself in later
life to repair it. His pride was involved in
proving it correct by applying it.</p>
<p>With this resolute concentration of purpose
there went an undaunted courage&mdash;a quality less
rare among English statesmen, but eminently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
laudable in him, because for great part of his
career he had no family or party connections to
back him up, but was obliged to face the world
with nothing but his own self-confidence. So far
from seeking to conceal his Jewish origin, he displayed
his pride in it, and refused all support to
the efforts which the Tory party made to maintain
the exclusion of Jews from Parliament. Nobody
showed more self-possession and (except on two
or three occasions) more perfect self-command in
the hot strife of Parliament than this suspected
stranger. His opponents learnt to fear one who
never feared for himself; his followers knew that
their chief would not fail them in the hour of
danger. His very face and bearing had in them
an impassive calmness which magnetised those
who watched him. He liked to surround himself
with mystery, to pose as remote, majestic, self-centred,
to appear above the need of a confidant.
He would sit for hours on his bench in the House
of Commons, listening with eyes half-shut to furious
assaults on himself and his policy, not showing by
the movement of a muscle that he had felt a
wound; and when he rose to reply would discharge
his sarcasms with an air of easy coolness. That
this indifference was sometimes simulated appeared
by the resentment he showed afterwards.</p>
<p>Ambition such as his could not afford to be
scrupulous, nor have his admirers ever claimed
conscientiousness as one of his merits. One who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
sets power and fame before him as the main
ends to be pursued may no doubt be restrained
by pride from the use of such means as are
obviously low and dishonourable. Other questionable
means he may reject because he knows
that the opinion of those whose good-will and
good word he must secure would condemn them.
But he will not be likely to allow kindliness or
compassion to stand in his way; nor will he be
very regardful of truth. To a statesman, who
must necessarily have many facts in his knowledge,
or many plans in his mind, which the
interests of his colleagues, or of his party, or of
the nation, forbid him to reveal, the temptation to
put questioners on a false scent, and to seem to
agree where he really dissents, is at all times a
strong one. An honest man may sometimes be
betrayed into yielding to it; and those who know
how difficult are the cases of conscience that arise
will not deal harshly with a possibly misleading
silence, or even with the evasion of an embarrassing
inquiry, where a real public interest can
be pleaded, for the existence of such a public
interest, if it does not justify, may palliate omissions
to make a full disclosure of the facts. All
things considered, the standard of truthfulness
among English public men has (of course with
some conspicuous exceptions) been a high one.
Of that standard Disraeli fell short. People did
not take his word for a thing as they would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
taken the word of the Duke of Wellington, or
Lord Althorp, or Lord Derby, or Lord Russell,
or even of that not very rigid moralist, Lord
Palmerston. Instances of his lapses were not
wanting as late as 1877. His behaviour toward
Sir Robert Peel, whom he plied with every dart
of sarcasm, after having shortly before lavished
praises on him, and sought office under him, has
often been commented on.<a name='FNanchor_0006' id='FNanchor_0006'></a><a href='#Footnote_0006' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> Disraeli was himself
(as those who knew him have often stated) accustomed
to justify it by observing that he was
then an insignificant personage, to whom it was
supremely important to attract public notice and
make a political position; that the opportunity
of attacking the powerful Prime Minister, at a
moment when their altered attitude towards the
Corn Laws had exposed the Ministry to the suspicions
of their own party, was too good to be
lost; and that he was therefore obliged to assail
Peel, though he had himself no particular attachment
to the Corn Laws, and believed Peel to have
been a <i>bona-fide</i> convert. It was therefore no
personal resentment against one who had slighted
him, but merely the exigencies of his own career,
that drove him to this course, whose fortunate
result proved the soundness of his calculations.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>This defence will not surprise any one who
is familiar with Disraeli&rsquo;s earlier novels. These
stories are as far as possible from being immoral;
that is to say, there is nothing in them unbecoming
or corrupting. Friendship, patriotism, love, are
all recognised as powerful and worthy motives of
conduct. That which is wanting is the sense of
right and wrong. His personages have for certain
purposes the conventional sense of honour, though
seldom a fine sense, but they do not ask whether
such and such a course is conformable to principle.
They move in a world which is polished, agreeable,
dignified, averse to baseness and vulgarity,
but in which conscience and religion scarcely
seem to exist. The men live for pleasure or
fame, the women for pleasure or love.</p>
<p>Some allowance must, of course, be made for
the circumstances of Disraeli&rsquo;s position and early
training. He was brought up neither a Jew nor
a Christian. The elder people who took him
by the hand when he entered life, people like
Samuel Rogers and Lady Blessington, were not
the people to give lessons in morality. Lord
Lyndhurst, the first of his powerful political
friends, and the man whose example most affected
him, was, with all his splendid gifts, conspicuously
wanting in political principle. Add to this the
isolation in which the young man found himself,
standing outside the common stream of English
life, not sharing its sentiments, perceiving the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
hollowness of much that passed for virtue and
patriotism, and it is easy to understand how he
should have been as perfect a cynic at twenty-five
as their experience of the world makes many
at sixty. If he had loved truth or mankind, he
might have quickly worked through his youthful
cynicism. But pride and ambition, the pride of
race and the pride of genius, left no room for
these sentiments. Nor was his cynicism the fruit
merely of a keen and sceptical intelligence. It
came from a cold heart.</p>
<p>The pursuit of fame and power, to which he
gave all his efforts, is presented in his writings as
the only alternative ideal to a life of pleasure; and
he probably regarded those who pursued some
other as either fools or weaklings. Early in his
political life he said one night to Mr. Bright
(from whom I heard the anecdote), as they took
their umbrellas in the cloak-room of the House
of Commons: &ldquo;After all, what is it that brings
you and me here? Fame! This is the true
arena. I might have occupied a literary throne;
but I have renounced it for this career.&rdquo; The
external pomps and trappings of life, titles, stately
houses and far-spreading parks, all those gauds and
vanities with which sumptuous wealth surrounds
itself, had throughout his life a singular fascination
for him. He liked to mock at them in his novels,
but they fascinated him none the less. One can
understand how they might fire the imagination
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
of an ambitious youth who saw them from a
distance&mdash;might even retain their charm for one
who was just struggling into the society which
possessed them, and who desired to feel himself
the equal of the possessors. It is stranger that,
when he had harnessed the English aristocracy
to his chariot, and was driving them where he
pleased, he should have continued to admire such
things. So, however, it was. There was even
in him a vein of inordinate deference to rank
and wealth which would in a less eminent person
have been called snobbishness. In his will he
directs that his estate of Hughenden Manor, in
Buckinghamshire, shall pass under an entail as
strict as he could devise, that the person who
succeeds to it shall always bear the name of
Disraeli. His ambition is the common, not to
say vulgar, ambition of the English <i>parvenu</i>,
to found a &ldquo;county family.&rdquo; In his story of
<i>Endymion</i>, published a few months before his
death, the hero, starting from small beginnings,
ends by becoming prime minister: this is the
crown of his career, the noblest triumph an
Englishman can achieve. It might have been
thought that one who had been through it all,
who had realised the dreams of his boyhood, who
had every opportunity of learning what power
and fame come to, would have liked to set forth
some other conception of the end of human life,
or would not have told the world so naively of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
self-content at having attained the aim he had
worked for. With most men the flower they have
plucked withers. It might have been expected
that one who was in other things an ironical cynic
would at least have sought to seem disillusionised.</p>
<p>To say that Disraeli&rsquo;s heart was somewhat
cold is by no means to say that he was heartless.
He was one of those strong natures who permit
neither persons nor principles to stand in their
way. His doctrine was that politics had nothing
to do with sentiment; so those who appealed to
him on grounds of humanity appealed in vain.
No act of his life ever so much offended English
opinion as the airy fashion in which he tossed aside
the news of the Bulgarian massacre of 1876. It
incensed sections who were strong enough, when
thoroughly roused, to bring about his fall. But
he was far from being unkindly. He knew how
to attach men to him by friendly deeds as well as
friendly words. He seldom missed an opportunity
of saying something pleasant and cheering
to a <i>d&eacute;butant</i> in Parliament, whether of his own
party or the opposite. He was not selfish in
little things; was always ready to consider the
comfort and convenience of those who surrounded
him. Age and success, so far from making him
morose or supercilious, softened the asperities of
his character and developed the affectionate side
of it. His last novel, published a few months
before his death, contains more human kindliness,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
a fuller recognition of the worth of friendship and
the beauty of sisterly and conjugal love, than do
the writings of his earlier manhood. What it
wants in intellectual power it makes up for in a
mellower and more tender tone. Of loyalty to
his political friends he was a model, and nothing
did more to secure his command of the party
than its sense that his professional honour, so to
speak, could be implicitly relied upon. To his
wife, a warm-hearted woman older than himself,
and inferior to him in education, he was uniformly
affectionate and indeed devoted. The
first use he made of his power as Prime
Minister was to procure for her the title of
viscountess. Being once asked point blank by a
lady what he thought of his life-long opponent,
Mr. Gladstone answered that two things had
always struck him as very admirable in Lord
Beaconsfield&rsquo;s character&mdash;his perfect loyalty to
his wife, and his perfect loyalty to his own race.
A story used to be told how, in Disraeli&rsquo;s earlier
days, when his political position was still far from
assured, he and his wife happened to be the
guests of the chief of the party, and that chief so
far forgot good manners as to quiz Mrs. Disraeli
at the dinner-table. Next morning Disraeli,
whose visit was to have lasted for some days
longer, announced that he must leave immediately.
The host besought him to stay, and made all
possible apologies. But Disraeli was inexorable,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
and carried off his wife forthwith. To literary
men, whatever their opinions, he was ready to
give a helping hand, representing himself as one
of their profession. In paying compliments he
was singularly expert, and few used the art so well
to win friends and disarm enemies. He knew how
to please Englishmen, and especially the young,
by showing interest in their tastes and pleasures,
and, without being what would be called genial,
was never wanting in <i>bonhomie</i>. In society he
was a perfect man of the world&mdash;told his anecdote
apropos, wound up a discussion by some
epigrammatic phrase, talked to the guest next
him, if he thought that guest&rsquo;s position made him
worth talking to, as he would to an old acquaintance.
But he had few intimates; nor did his
apparent frankness unveil his real thoughts.</p>
<p>He was not of those who complicate political
opposition with private hatreds. Looking on
politics as a game, he liked, when he took off
his armour, to feel himself on friendly terms with
his antagonists, and often seemed surprised to
find that they remembered as personal affronts
the blows which he had dealt in the tournament.
Two or three years before his death, a friend
asked him whether there was in London any one
with whom he would not shake hands. Reflecting
for a moment, he answered, &ldquo;Only one,&rdquo; and
named Robert Lowe, who had said hard things of
him, and to whom, when Lowe was on one occasion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
in his power, he had behaved with cruelty. Yet
his resentments could smoulder long. In <i>Lothair</i>
he attacked, under a thin disguise, a distinguished
man of letters who had criticised his conduct years
before. In <i>Endymion</i> he gratified what was evidently
an ancient grudge by a spiteful presentation
of Thackeray, as he had indulged his more bitter
dislike of John Wilson Croker by portraying
that politician in <i>Coningsby</i> under the name of
Nicholas Rigby. For the greatest of his adversaries
he felt, there is reason to believe,
genuine admiration, mingled with inability to
comprehend a nature so unlike his own. No
passage in the striking speech which that adversary
pronounced, one might almost say, over
Lord Beaconsfield&rsquo;s grave&mdash;a speech which may
possibly go down to posterity with its subject&mdash;was
more impressive than the sentence in which
he declared that he had the best reason to believe
that, in their constant warfare, Lord Beaconsfield
had not been actuated by any personal hostility.
Brave men, if they can respect, seldom dislike, a
formidable antagonist.</p>
<p>His mental powers were singularly well suited
to the rest of his character&mdash;were, so to speak,
all of a piece with it. One sometimes sees intellects
which are out of keeping with the active
or emotional parts of the man. One sees persons
whose thought is vigorous, clear, comprehensive,
while their conduct is timid; or a comparatively
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
narrow intelligence joined to an enterprising
spirit; or a sober, reflective, sceptical turn of mind
yoked to an ardent and impulsive temperament.
What we call the follies of the wise often spring
from some such source. Not so with him. His
intelligence had the same boldness, intensity, concentration,
directness, which we discover in the
rest of the man. It was just the right instrument,
not perhaps for the normal career of a
normal Englishman seeking political success, but
for the particular kind of work Disraeli had
planned to do; and this inner harmony was one
of the chief causes of his success, as the want of it
has caused the failure of so many gifted natures.</p>
<p>The range of his mind was not wide. All its
products were like one another. No one of them
gives the impression that Disraeli could, had he so
wished, have succeeded in a wholly diverse line.
It was a peculiar mind: there is even more variety
in minds than in faces. It was not logical or discursive,
liking to mass and arrange stores of knowledge,
and draw inferences from them, nor was it
judicial, with a turn for weighing reasons and
reaching a decision which recognises all the facts
and is not confused by their seeming contradictions.
Neither was it analytically subtle. It
reached its conclusions by a process of intuition
or divination in which there was an imaginative
as well as a reflective element. It might almost
have been called an artist&rsquo;s mind, capable of deep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
meditation, but meditating in an imaginative way,
not so much on facts as on its own views of
facts, on the pictures which its own creative
faculty had called up. The meditation became
dreamy, but the dreaminess was corrected by an
exceedingly keen and quick power of observation,
not the scientific observation of the philosopher,
but rather the enjoying observation of the artist
who sees how he can use the characteristic
details which he notes, or the observation of
the forensic advocate (an artist, too, in his way)
who perceives how they can be fitted into the presentation
of his case. There are, of course, other
qualities in Disraeli&rsquo;s work. As a statesman he
was obliged to learn how to state facts, to argue,
to dissect an opponent&rsquo;s arguments. But the
characteristic note, both of his speeches and of
his writings, is the combination of a few large
ideas, clear, perhaps, to himself, but generally
expressed with grandiose vagueness, and often
quite out of relation to the facts as other people
saw them, with a turn for acutely fastening
upon small incidents or personal traits. In his
speeches he used his command of sonorous
phrases and lively illustrations, sometimes to
support the views he was advancing, but more
frequently to conceal the weakness of those
views; that is, to make up for the absence of
such solid arguments as were likely to move his
hearers. Everybody is now and then conscious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
of holding with assured conviction theories which
he would find it hard to prove to a given
audience, partly because it is too much trouble
to trace out the process by which they were
reached, partly because uninstructed listeners
could not be made to feel the full cogency of
the considerations on which his own mind
relies. Disraeli was usually in this condition
with regard to his political and social doctrines.
He believed them, but as he had not reached
them by logic, he was not prepared to use
logic to establish them; so he picked up some
plausible illustration, or attacked the opposite
doctrine and its supporters with a fire of raillery
or invective. This non-ratiocinative quality of
his thinking was a source both of strength and
of weakness&mdash;of weakness, because he could
not prove his propositions; of strength, because,
stated as he stated them, it was not less hard
to disprove them. That mark of a superior
mind, that it must have a theory, was never
wanting. Some one said of him that he was
&ldquo;the ruins of a thinker.&rdquo; He could not rest
content, like many among his followers, with a
prejudice, a dogma delivered by tradition, a stolid
suspicion unamenable to argument. He would
not acquiesce in negation. He must have a
theory, a positive theory, to show not only that
his antagonist&rsquo;s view was erroneous, but that he
had himself a more excellent way. These theories
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
generally had in them a measure of truth and
value for any one who could analyse them; but
as this was exactly what the rank and file of the
party could not do, they got into sad confusion
when they tried to talk his language.</p>
<p>He could hardly be called a well-read man,
nor were his intellectual interests numerous. His
education had consisted mainly in promiscuous
reading during boyhood and early youth. There
are worse kinds of education for an active intelligence
than to let it have the run of a large
library. The wild browsings of youth, when
curiosity is strong as hunger, stir the mind and
give the memory some of the best food it ever
gets. The weak point of such a method is that it
does not teach accuracy nor the art of systematic
study. In middle life natural indolence and his
political occupations had kept Disraeli from filling
up the gaps in his knowledge, while, in conversation,
what he liked best was persiflage. He
was, however, tolerably familiar with the ancient
classics, and with modern English and French
literature; enjoyed Quintilian and Lucian, preferred
Sophocles to &AElig;schylus and (apparently) Horace
to Virgil, despised Browning, considered Tennyson
the best of contemporary poets, but &ldquo;not a
poet of a high order.&rdquo;<a name='FNanchor_0007' id='FNanchor_0007'></a><a href='#Footnote_0007' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a> Physical science seems
never to have attracted him. Political economy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
he hated and mocked at almost as heartily as
did Carlyle. People have measured his knowledge
of history and geography by observing
that he placed the Crucifixion in the lifetime
of Augustus, and thought, down till 1878, when
he had to make a speech about Afghanistan, that
the Andes were the highest mountains in the
world. But geography is a subject which a man
of affairs does not think of reading up in later
life: he is content if he can get information
when he needs it. There are some bits of metaphysics
and some historical allusions scattered
over his novels, but these are mostly slight or
superficial. He amused himself and the public
by now and then propounding doctrines on agricultural
matters, but would not appear to have
mastered either husbandry or any other economical
or commercial subject. Such things were not
in his way. He had been so little in office as
not to have been forced to apply himself to them,
while the tide of pure intellectual curiosity had
long since ebbed.</p>
<p>For so-called &ldquo;sports&rdquo; he had little taste. He
liked to go mooning in a meditative way round his
fields and copses, and he certainly enjoyed Nature;
but there seems to be no solid evidence that the
primrose was his favourite flower. In his fondness
for particular words and phrases there
was a touch of his artistic quality, and a touch
also of the cynical view that words are the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
counters with which the wise play their game.
There is a passage in <i>Contarini Fleming</i> (a story
into which he has put a good deal of himself)
where this is set out. Contarini tells his father
that he left college &ldquo;because they taught me only
words, and I wished to learn ideas.&rdquo; His father
answers, &ldquo;Few ideas are correct ones, and what
are correct, no one can ascertain; but with words
we govern men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went on acting on this belief in the power
of words till he became the victim of his own
phrases, just as people who talk cynically for
effect grow sometimes into real cynics. When
he had invented a phrase which happily expressed
the aspect he wished his view, or some part of his
policy, to bear, he came to believe in the phrase,
and to think that the facts were altered by the
colour the phrase put upon them. During the
contest for the extension of the parliamentary
franchise, he declared himself &ldquo;in favour of
popular privileges, but opposed to democratic
rights.&rdquo; When he was accused of having assented,
at the Congress of Berlin, to the dismemberment
of the Turkish Empire, he said
that what had been done was &ldquo;not dismemberment,
but consolidation.&rdquo; No statesman of recent
times has given currency to so many quasi-epigrammatic
expressions: &ldquo;organised hypocrisy,&rdquo;
&ldquo;England dislikes coalitions,&rdquo; &ldquo;plundering and
blundering,&rdquo; &ldquo;peace with honour,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>imperium
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
et libertas</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;a scientific frontier,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am on
the side of the angels,&rdquo; are a few, not perhaps
the best, though the best remembered, of the
many which issued from his fertile mint. This
turn for epigram, not common in England,
sometimes led him into scrapes which would
have damaged a man of less imperturbable
coolness. No one else could have ventured to
say, when he had induced the Tories to pass
a Reform Bill stronger than the one they had
rejected from the Liberals in the preceding
year, that it had been his mission &ldquo;to educate
his party.&rdquo; Some of his opponents professed
to be shocked by such audacity, and many
old Tories privily gnashed their teeth. But the
country received the dictum in the spirit in which
it was spoken. &ldquo;It was Disraeli all over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If his intellect was not of wide range, it was
within its range a weapon of the finest flexibility
and temper. It was ingenious, ready, incisive.
It detected in a moment the weak point, if not of
an argument, yet of an attitude or of a character.
Its imaginative quality made it often picturesque,
sometimes even impressive. Disraeli had the
artist&rsquo;s delight in a situation for its own sake, and
what people censured as insincerity or frivolity was
frequently only the zest which he felt in posing,
not so much because there was anything to be
gained, as because he realised his aptitude for
improvising a new part in the drama which he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
always felt himself to be playing. The humour of
the situation was too good to be wasted. Perhaps
this love of merry mischief may have had something
to do with his tendency to confer honours
on those whom the world thought least deserving.</p>
<p>His books are not only a valuable revelation
of his mind, but have more literary merit than
critics have commonly allowed to them, perhaps
because we are apt, when a man excels in one
walk, to deem him to have failed in any other
wherein he does not reach the same level. The
novels foam over with cleverness; indeed, <i>Vivian
Grey</i>, with all its youthful faults, gives as great
an impression of intellectual brilliance as does
anything Disraeli ever wrote or spoke. Their
easy fertility makes them seem to be only,
so to speak, a few sketches out of a large
portfolio. There is some variety in the subjects&mdash;<i>Contarini
Fleming</i> and <i>Tancred</i> are
more romantic than the others, <i>Sybil</i> and <i>Coningsby</i>
more political&mdash;as well as in the merits
of the stories. The two latest, <i>Lothair</i> and
<i>Endymion</i>, works of his old age, are markedly
inferior in spirit and invention; but the general
features are the same in all&mdash;a lively fancy, a
knack of hitting characters off in a few lines and
of catching the superficial aspects of society, a
brisk narrative, a sprightly dialogue, a keen insight
into the selfishness of men and the vanities of
women, with flashes of wit lighting up the whole
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
stage. It is always a stage. The brilliance
is never open-air sunshine. There is scarcely one
of the characters whom we feel we might have
met and known. Heroes and heroines are
theatrical figures; their pathos rings false, their
love, though described as passionate, does not
spring from the inner recesses of the soul. The
studies of men of the world, and particularly of
heartless ones, are the most life-like; yet, even
here, any one who wants to feel the difference
between the great painter and the clever sketcher
need only compare Thackeray&rsquo;s Marquis of
Steyne with Disraeli&rsquo;s Marquis of Monmouth,
both of them suggested by the same original.
There is little intensity, little dramatic power
in these stories, as also in his play of <i>Alarcos</i>;
and if we read them with pleasure it is not
for the sake either of plot or of character,
but because they contain so many sparkling
witticisms and reflections, setting in a strong
light, yet not always an unkindly light, the seamy
side of politics and human nature. The slovenliness
of their style, which is often pompous, but
seldom pure, makes them appear to have been
written hastily. But Disraeli seems to have
taken the composition of them (except, perhaps,
the two latest) quite seriously. When he wrote
the earlier tales, he meant to achieve literary
greatness; while the middle ones, especially
<i>Coningsby</i> and <i>Sybil</i>, were designed as political
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
manifestoes. The less they have a purpose or
profess to be serious, the better they are; and
the most vivacious of all are two classical burlesques,
written at a time when that kind of
composition had not yet become common&mdash;<i>Ixion
in Heaven</i> and <i>The Infernal Marriage</i>&mdash;little
pieces of funning worthy of Thackeray,
I had almost said of Voltaire. They recall,
perhaps they were suggested by, similar pieces
of Lucian&rsquo;s. Is Semitic genius specially rich in
this mocking vein? Lucian was a Syrian from
Samosata, probably a Semite; Heinrich Heine
was a Semite; James Russell Lowell used to
insist, though he produced little evidence for his
belief, that Voltaire was a Semite.</p>
<p>Whether Disraeli could ever have taken high
rank as a novelist if he had thrown himself completely
into the profession may be doubted, for his
defects were such as pains and practice would hardly
have lessened. That he had still less the imagination
needed by a poet, his <i>Revolutionary Epick</i>, conceived
on the plains of Troy, and meant to make
a fourth to the <i>Iliad</i>, the <i>&AElig;neid</i>, and the <i>Divina
Commedia</i>, is enough to show. The literary
vocation he was best fitted for was that of a
journalist or pamphleteer; and in this he might
have won unrivalled success. His dash, his
verve, his brilliancy of illustration, his scorching
satire, would have made the fortune of any newspaper,
and carried dismay into the enemy&rsquo;s ranks.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></div>
<p>In inquiring how far the gifts I have sought to
describe qualified Disraeli for practical statesmanship,
it is well to distinguish the different kinds
of capacity which an English politician needs to
attain the highest place. They may be said to
be four. He must be a debater. He must be a
parliamentary tactician. He must understand the
country. He must understand Europe. This last
is, indeed, not always necessary; there have been
moments when England, leaving Europe to itself,
may look to her own affairs only; but when the
sky grows stormy over Europe, the want of knowledge
which English statesmen sometimes evince
may bode disaster.</p>
<p>An orator, in the highest sense of the word,
Disraeli never was. He lacked ease and fluency.
He had not Pitt&rsquo;s turn for the lucid exposition of
complicated facts, nor for the conduct of a close
argument. The sustained and fiery declamation of
Fox was equally beyond his range. And least of
all had he that truest index of eloquence, the power
of touching the emotions. He could not make his
hearers weep. But he could make them laugh;
he could put them in good-humour with themselves;
he could dazzle them with rhetoric;
he could pour upon an opponent streams of
ridicule more effective than the hottest indignation.
When he sought to be profound or solemn,
he was usually heavy and laboured&mdash;the sublimity
often false, the diction often stilted. For wealth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
of thought or splendour of language his speeches
will not bear to be compared&mdash;I will not say with
those of Burke (on whom he sometimes tried to
model himself), but with those of three or four of
his own contemporaries. Even within his own
party, Lord Derby, Lord Ellenborough, and Lord
Cairns in their several ways surpassed him. There
is not one of his longer and more finished harangues
which can be read with interest from beginning to
end. But there is hardly any among them which
does not contain some striking passage, some
image or epigram, or burst of sarcasm, which
must have been exceedingly effective when delivered.
It is partly upon these isolated passages,
especially the sarcastic ones (though the witticisms
were sometimes borrowed), and still more upon
the aptness of the speech to the circumstances
under which it was made, that his parliamentary
fame rests. If he was not a great orator he was
a superb debater, who watched with the utmost
care the temper of the audience, and said just
what was needed at the moment to disconcert an
opponent or to put heart into his friends. His
repartees were often happy, and must sometimes
have been unpremeditated. As he had not the
ardent temperament of the born orator, so neither
had he the external advantages which count for
much before large assemblies. His voice was
not remarkable either for range or for quality.
His manner was somewhat stiff, his gestures few,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
his countenance inexpressive. Yet his delivery
was not wanting in skill, and often added point,
by its cool unconcern, to a stinging epigram.</p>
<p>What he lacked in eloquence he made up
for by tactical adroitness. No more consummate
parliamentary strategist has been seen in
England. He had studied the House of Commons
till he knew it as a player knows his instrument&mdash;studied
it collectively, for it has a collective
character, and studied the men who compose
it: their worse rather than their better side,
their prejudices, their foibles, their vanities,
their ambitions, their jealousies, above all, that
curious corporate pride which they have, and
which makes them resent any approach to dictation.
He could play on every one of these
strings, and yet so as to conceal his skill; and he
so economised himself as to make them always
wish to hear him. He knew how in a body of
men obliged to listen to talk, and most of it
tedious talk, about matters in themselves mostly
uninteresting, the desire for a little amusement
becomes almost a passion; and he humoured
this desire so far as occasionally to err by
excess of banter and flippancy. Almost always
respectful to the House, he had a happy
knack of appearing to follow rather than to
lead, and when he made an official statement
it was with the air of one who was taking
them into his confidence. Much of this he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
may have learned from observing Lord Palmerston;
but the art came more naturally to that
statesman, who was an Englishman all through,
than to a man of Mr. Disraeli&rsquo;s origin, who
looked on Englishmen from outside, and never
felt himself, so to speak, responsible for their
habits or ideas.</p>
<p>As leader of his party in Opposition, he was
at once daring and cautious. He never feared
to give battle, even when he expected defeat,
if he deemed it necessary, with a view to the
future, that the judgment of his party should
have been pronounced in a formal way. On
the other hand, he was wary of committing himself
to a policy of blind or obstinate resistance.
When he perceived that the time had come to
yield, he knew how to yield with a good grace,
so as both to support a character for reasonableness
and to obtain valuable concessions as
the price of peace. If difficulties arose with
foreign countries he claimed full liberty of
criticising the conduct of the Ministry, but
ostentatiously abstained from obstructing or
thwarting their acts, declaring that England must
always present a united front to the foreigner,
whatever penalties she might afterwards visit
on those who had mismanaged her concerns.
As regards the inner discipline of his party,
he had enormous difficulties to surmount in the
jealousy which many Tories felt for him as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
new man, a man whom they could not understand
and only partially trusted.<a name='FNanchor_0008' id='FNanchor_0008'></a><a href='#Footnote_0008' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> Conspiracies
were repeatedly formed against him; malcontents
attacked him in the press, and sometimes even in
Parliament. These he seldom noticed, maintaining
a cool and self-confident demeanour which
disheartened the plotters, and discharging the
duties of his post with steady assiduity. He
was always on the look-out for young men of
promise, drew them towards him, encouraged
them to help him in parliamentary sharp-shooting,
and fostered in every way the spirit of party.
The bad side of that spirit was seen when he
came into office, for then every post in the
public service was bestowed either by mere
favouritism or on party grounds; and men who
had been loyal to him were rewarded by places
or titles to which they had no other claim.
But the unity and martial fervour of the Tory
party was raised to the highest point. Nor was
Disraeli himself personally unpopular with his
parliamentary opponents, even when he was most
hotly attacked on the platform and in the press.</p>
<p>To know England and watch the shifting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
currents of its opinion is a very different matter
from knowing the House of Commons. Indeed,
the two kinds of knowledge are in a measure
incompatible. Men who enter Parliament soon
begin to forget that it is not, in the last resort,
Parliament that governs, but the people. Absorbed
in the daily contests of their Chamber,
they over-estimate the importance of those contests.
They come to think that Parliament is
in fact what it is in theory, a microcosm of
the nation, and that opinion inside is sure to
reflect the opinion outside. When they are in a
minority they are depressed; when they are in
a majority they fancy that all is well, forgetting
their masters out-of-doors. This tendency is
aggravated by the fact that the English Parliament
meets in the capital, where the rich and
luxurious congregate and give their tone to
society. The House of Commons, though many
of its members belong to the middle class by
origin, belongs practically to the upper class by
sympathy, and is prone to believe that what it
hears every evening at dinners or receptions is
what the country is thinking. A member of the
House of Commons is, therefore, ill-placed for
feeling the pulse of the nation, and in order to
do so must know what is being said over the
country, and must frequently visit or communicate
with his constituents. If this difficulty is
experienced by an ordinary private member, it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
is greater for a minister whose time is filled
by official duties, or for a leader of Opposition,
who has to be constantly thinking of his tactics
in the House. In Disraeli&rsquo;s case there was a
keenness of observation and discernment far
beyond the common. But he was under the disadvantages
of not being really an Englishman,
and of having never lived among the people.<a name='FNanchor_0009' id='FNanchor_0009'></a><a href='#Footnote_0009' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a>
The detachment I have already referred to tended
to weaken his power of judging popular sentiment,
and appraising at their true value the various
tendencies that sway and divide a nation so
complex as the English. Early in life he had
formed theories about the relations of the different
classes of English society&mdash;nobility, gentry,
capitalists, workmen, peasantry, and the middle
classes&mdash;theories which were far from containing
the whole truth; and he adhered to them even
when the changes of half a century had made them
less true. He had a great aversion, not to say contempt,
for Puritanism, and for the Dissenters among
whom it chiefly holds its ground, and pleased himself
with the notion that the extension of the suffrage
which he carried in 1867 had destroyed their
political power. The Conservative victory at the
election of 1874 confirmed him in this belief, and
made him also think that the working classes
were ready to follow the lead of the rich. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
perceived that the Liberal ministry of 1868-74
had offended certain influential sections by appearing
too demiss or too unenterprising in foreign
affairs, and fancied that the bulk of the nation
would be dazzled by a warlike mien, and an
active, even aggressive, foreign policy. Such a
policy was congenial to his own ideas, and to
the society that surrounded him. It was applauded
by some largely circulated newspapers
which had previously been unfriendly to the
Tory party. Thus he was more surprised than
any other man of similar experience to find the
nation sending up a larger majority against him
in 1880 than it had sent up for him in 1874.
This was the most striking instance of his miscalculation.
But he had all through his career
an imperfect comprehension of the English
people. Individuals, or even an assembly, may
be understood by dint of close and long-continued
observation; but to understand a whole nation,
one must also have sympathy, and this his circumstances,
not less than his character, had denied him.</p>
<p>It was partly the same defect that prevented
him from mastering the general politics of Europe.
There is a sense in which no single man can
pretend to understand Europe. Bismarck himself
did not. The problem is too vast, the facts
to be known too numerous, the undercurrents
too varying. One can speak only of more or
less. If Europe had been in his time what it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
was a century before, Disraeli would have had
a far better chance of being fit to become what
it was probably his dearest wish to become&mdash;its
guide and arbiter. He would have taken the
measure of the princes and ministers with whom
he had to deal, would have seen and adroitly
played on their weaknesses. His novels show
how often he had revolved diplomatic situations
in his mind, and reflected on the way of handling
them. Foreign diplomatists are agreed that at
the Congress of Berlin he played his part to
admiration, spoke seldom, but spoke always to
the point and with dignity, had a perfect conception
of what he meant to secure, and of the
means he must employ to secure it, never haggled
over details or betrayed any eagerness to win
support, never wavered in his demands, even when
they seemed to lead straight to war. Dealing
with individuals, who represented material forces
which he had gauged, he was perfectly at home,
and deserved the praise he obtained from Bismarck,
who, comparing him with other eminent
figures at the Congress, is reported to have said,
bluntly but heartily, &ldquo;Der alte Jude, das ist der
Mann.&rdquo;<a name='FNanchor_0010' id='FNanchor_0010'></a><a href='#Footnote_0010' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a> But to know what the condition of
South-Eastern Europe really was, and understand
how best to settle its troubles, was a far more difficult
task, and Disraeli possessed neither the knowledge
nor the insight required. In the Europe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
of to-day, peoples count for more than the wills
of individual rulers: one must comprehend the
passions and sympathies of peoples if one is to
forecast the future. This he seldom cared to
do. He did not realise the part and the power
of moral forces. Down to the outbreak of the
American Civil War he maintained that the
question between the North and the South was
mainly a fiscal question between the Protectionist
interests of the one and the Free Trade interests
of the other. He always treated with contempt
the national movement in Italy. He made no
secret in the days before 1859 of his good-will
to Austria and of his liking for Louis Napoleon&mdash;a
man inferior to him in ability and in courage,
but to whose character his own had some affinities.
In that elaborate study of Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;s character,<a name='FNanchor_0011' id='FNanchor_0011'></a><a href='#Footnote_0011' class='fnanchor'>[12]</a>
which is one of Disraeli&rsquo;s best literary performances,
he observes that Peel &ldquo;was destitute
of imagination, and wanting imagination he wanted
prescience.&rdquo; True it is that imagination is necessary
for prescience, but imagination is not enough
to give prescience. It may even be a snare.</p>
<p>Disraeli&rsquo;s imagination, his fondness for theories,
and disposition rather to cling to them than to
study and interpret facts, made him the victim
of his own preconceived ideas, as his indolence
deterred him from following the march of change
and noting how different things were in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
&rsquo;seventies from what they had been in the
&rsquo;thirties. Mr. Gladstone said to me in 1876,
&ldquo;Disraeli&rsquo;s two leading ideas in foreign policy
have always been the maintenance of the temporal
power of the Pope, and the maintenance of the
power of the Sultan.&rdquo; Unable to save the one, he
clung to the hope of saving the other. He was
possessed by the notion, seductive to a dreamy
mind, that all the disturbances of Europe arose
from the action of secret societies; and when the
Eastern Question was in 1875 re-opened by the
insurrection in Herzegovina, followed by the
war of Servia against the Turks, he explained
the event in a famous speech by saying, &ldquo;The
secret societies of Europe have declared war
against Turkey&rdquo;&mdash;the fact being that the societies
which in Russia were promoting the Servian war
were public societies, openly collecting subscriptions,
while those secret &ldquo;social democratic&rdquo;
societies of which we have since heard so much
were strongly opposed to the interference of
Russia, and those other secret societies in the
rest of Europe, wherein Poles and Italians have
played a leading part, were, if not hostile, at any
rate quite indifferent to the movement among the
Eastern Christians.</p>
<p>Against these errors there must be set several
cases in which he showed profound discernment.
In 1843 and 1844 he delivered, in debates on the
condition of Ireland, speeches which then constituted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
and long remained the most penetrating
and concise diagnosis of the troubles of that country
ever addressed to Parliament. Ireland has, he
said, a starving peasantry, an alien church, and an
absentee aristocracy, and he went on to add that
the function of statesmanship was to cure by peaceful
and constitutional methods ills which in other
countries had usually induced, and been removed
by, revolution. During the American Civil War of
1861-65, Disraeli was the only leading statesman
on his own side of politics who did not embrace and
applaud the cause of the South. Whether this
arose from a caution that would not commit itself
where it recognised ignorance, or from a perception
of the superior strength of the Northern
States (a perception which whoever visits the
South even to-day is astonished that so few
people in Europe should have had), it is not easy
to decide; but whatever the cause, the fact is an
evidence of his prudence or sagacity all the more
weighty because Lord Palmerston, Lord Russell,
and Mr. Gladstone, as well as Lord Derby and
Sir Hugh Cairns, had each of them expressed
more or less sympathy with, or belief in, the
success of the Southern cause.</p>
<p>The most striking instance, however, of Disraeli&rsquo;s
insight was his perception that an extension
of the suffrage would not necessarily injure,
and might end by strengthening, the Tory party.
The Act of 1867 was described at the time as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
&ldquo;a leap in the dark.&rdquo; But Disraeli&rsquo;s eyes had
pierced the darkness. For half a century politicians
had assumed that the masses of the people
were and would remain under the Liberal banner.
Even as late as 1872 it was thought on Liberal
platforms a good joke to say of some opinion that
it might do for Conservative working men, if there
were any. Disraeli had, long before 1867, seen
deeper, and though his youthful fancies that the
monarchy might be revived as an effective force,
and that &ldquo;the peasantry&rdquo; would follow with
medi&aelig;val reverence the lead of the landed gentry,
proved illusory, he was right in discerning that
wealth and social influence would in parliamentary
elections count for more among the masses than
the traditions of constitutional Whiggism or the
dogmas of abstract Radicalism.</p>
<p>In estimating his statesmanship as a whole,
one must give due weight to the fact that it
impressed many publicists abroad. No English
minister had for a long time past so fascinated
observers in Germany and Austria. Supposing
that under the long reign of Liberalism Englishmen
had ceased to care for foreign politics, they
looked on him as the man who had given back to
Britain her old European position, and attributed
to him a breadth of design, a grasp and a foresight
such as men had revered in Lord Chatham,
greatest in the short list of ministers who have
raised the fame of England abroad. I remember
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
seeing in a Conservative club, about 1880, a
large photograph of Lord Beaconsfield, wearing
the well-known look of mysterious fixity, under
which is inscribed the line of Homer: &ldquo;He alone
is wise: the rest are fleeting shadows.&rdquo;<a name='FNanchor_0012' id='FNanchor_0012'></a><a href='#Footnote_0012' class='fnanchor'>[13]</a> It
was a happy idea to go for a motto to the
favourite poet of his rival, as it was an unhappy
chance to associate the wisdom ascribed
to Disraeli with his policy in the Turkish East
and in Afghanistan, a policy now universally admitted
to have been unwise and unfortunate.<a name='FNanchor_0013' id='FNanchor_0013'></a><a href='#Footnote_0013' class='fnanchor'>[14]</a>
But whatever may be thought of the appropriateness
of the motto, the fact remains that this was
the belief he succeeded in inspiring. He did it
by virtue of those very gifts which sometimes
brought him into trouble&mdash;his taste for large and
imposing theories, his power of clothing them in
vague and solemn language, his persistent faith in
them. He came, by long posing, to impose upon
himself and to believe in his own profundity.
Few people could judge whether his ideas of
imperial policy were sound and feasible; but
every one saw that he had theories, and many
fell under the spell which a grandiose imagination
can exercise. It is chiefly this gift, coupled with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
his indomitable tenacity, which lifts him out of
the line of mere party leaders. If he failed to see
how much the English are sometimes moved by
compassion, he did see that it may be worth while
to play to their imagination.</p>
<p>We may now ask again the question asked at
first: How did a man, whatever his natural gifts,
who was weighted in his course by such disadvantages
as Disraeli&rsquo;s, by his Jewish origin, by the
escapades of his early career, by the want of confidence
which his habitual cynicism inspired, by the
visionary nature of so many of his views,&mdash;how did
he, in a conservative and aristocratic country like
England, triumph over so many prejudices and
enmities, and raise himself to be the head of the
Conservative and aristocratic party, the trusted
counsellor of the Crown, the ruler, almost the
dictator, of a free people?</p>
<p>However high be the estimate formed of
Disraeli&rsquo;s gifts, secondary causes must have been
at work to enable him to overcome the obstacles
that blocked his path. The ancients were not
wrong in ascribing to Fortune a great share in
human affairs. Now, among the secondary causes
of success, that &ldquo;general minister and leader set
over worldly splendours,&rdquo; as Dante calls her,<a name='FNanchor_0014' id='FNanchor_0014'></a><a href='#Footnote_0014' class='fnanchor'>[15]</a>
played no insignificant part. One of these causes
lay in the nature of the party to which he belonged.
The Tory party of the years between 1848 and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
1865 contained a comparatively small number of
able men. When J. S. Mill once called it the
stupid party, it did not repudiate the name, but
pointed to its cohesion and its resolution as
showing how many things besides mere talent
go to make political greatness. A man of
shining gifts had within its ranks few competitors;
and this was signally the case immediately
after Peel&rsquo;s defection. That statesman
had carried off with him the intellectual flower
of the Conservatives. Those who were left
behind to form the Protectionist Opposition in
the House of Commons were broad-acred squires,
of solid character but slender capacity. Through
this heavy atmosphere Mr. Disraeli rose like a
balloon. Being practically the only member of
his party in the Commons with either strategical
or debating power, he became indispensable, and
soon established a supremacy which years of
patient labour might not have given him in a
rivalry with the distinguished band who surrounded
Peel. During the twenty years that
followed the great Tory schism of 1846 no
man arose in the Tory ranks capable of disputing
his throne. The conspiracies hatched
against him might well have prospered could a
candidate for the leadership have been found
capable of crossing swords with the chieftain in
possession. Fortune, true to her nursling, suffered
none such to appear.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></div>
<p>Another favouring influence not understood
outside England was to be found in the character
of the party he led. In his day the Tories, being
the party of the property-holders, and having not
to advance but to stand still, not to propose
changes but to resist them, having bonds of
interest as well as of sentiment to draw them
close together, possessed a cohesion, a loyalty
to their chiefs, a tenacious corporate spirit, far
exceeding what was to be found among their
adversaries, who were usually divided into a
moderate or Whig and an advanced or Radical
section. He who established himself as the Tory
leader was presently followed by the rank and file
with a devotion, an unquestioning submission and
confidence, which placed his character and doctrines
under the &aelig;gis of the party, and enforced loyalty
upon parliamentary malcontents. This corporate
spirit was of infinite value to Disraeli. The
historical past of the great Tory party, its associations,
the social consideration which it enjoys, all
went to ennoble his position and efface the remembrance
of the less creditable parts of his career.
And in the later days of his reign, when no one
disputed his supremacy, every Tory was, as a
matter of course, his advocate and admirer, and
resented assaults on him as insults to the party.
When a man excites hatred by his words or deeds,
attacks on his character are an inevitable relief to
overcharged feelings. Technically regarded, they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
are not good politics. Misrepresentation sometimes
succeeds; vituperation seldom. Let a man
be personally untrustworthy or dangerous, still, it
is only his own words that damage him, at least in
England and America. Even his own words, however
discrediting, even his acts, however culpable,
may, if they belong to a past unfamiliar to the voter
of to-day, tell little, perhaps too little, on the voter&rsquo;s
mind when they are brought up against him. The
average citizen has a short memory, and thinks
that the dead may be allowed to bury their dead.</p>
<p>Let it be further noted that Disraeli&rsquo;s career
coincided with a significant change in English
politics, a change partly in the temper of the nation,
partly in the balance of voting power. For thirty
years after the Reform Act of 1832, not only had
the middle classes constituted the majority of
the electors, but the social influence of the great
Whig families and the intellectual influence of
the economic school of Cobden had been potent
factors. These forces were, in the later part of
Disraeli&rsquo;s life, tending to decline. The working-class
vote was vastly increased in 1867. The
old Whig light gradually paled, and many of the
Whig magnates, obeying class sympathies rather
than party traditions, drifted slowly into Toryism.
A generation arose which had not seen the Free
Trade struggle, or had forgotten the Free Trade
arguments, and which was attracted by ideals other
than those which Cobden had preached. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
grievances which had made men reformers had
been largely removed. The battle of liberty and
nationality in Continental Europe had been in
the main won, and Englishmen had lost the
enthusiasm for freedom which had fired them in
the days when the memory of their own struggle
against the Crown and the oligarchy was still
fresh. With none of these changes had Disraeli&rsquo;s
personal action much to do, but they all enured
to the benefit of his party, they all swelled the
tide which bore him into office in 1874.</p>
<p>Finally, he had the great advantage of living
long. Many a statesman has died at fifty,
and passed from the world&rsquo;s memory, who might
have become a figure in history with twenty years
more of life. Had Disraeli&rsquo;s career closed in
1854, he would have been remembered as a
parliamentary gladiator, who had produced a few
incisive speeches, a crude Budget, and some
brilliant social and political sketches. The
stronger parts of his character might have remained
unknown. True it is that a man must
have greatness in order to stand the test of long
life. Some are found out, like Louis Napoleon.
Some lose their balance and therewith their
influence, like Lord Brougham. Some cease to
grow or learn, and if a statesman is not better
at sixty than he was at thirty, he is worse.
Some jog heavily on, like Metternich, or stiffen
into arbitrary doctrinaires, like Guizot. Disraeli
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
did not merely stand the test, he gained immensely
by it. He gained by rising into a
position where his strength could show itself.
He gained also by so impressing his individuality
upon people as to make them accept it as an
ultimate fact, till at length they came, not so much
to blame him for what he did in accord with his
established reputation, as rather to relish and
enter into the humour of his character. As they
unconsciously took to judging him by a standard
different from that which they applied to ordinary
Englishmen, they hardly complained of deflections
from veracity which would have seemed grave
in other persons. He had given notice that
he was not like other men, that his words must
not be taken in their natural sense, that he was
to be regarded as the skilful player of a great
game, the consummate actor in a great part.
And, once more, he gained by the many years
during which he had opportunities of displaying
his fortitude, patience, constancy under defeat,
unwavering self-confidence&mdash;gifts rarer than mere
intellectual power, gifts that deserve the influence
they bestow. Nothing so fascinates mankind as
to see a man equal to every fortune, unshaken
by reverses, indifferent to personal abuse, maintaining
a long combat against apparently hopeless
odds with the sharpest weapons and a smiling
face. His followers fancy he must have hidden
resources of wisdom as well as of courage. When
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
some of his predictions come true, and the
turning tide of popular feeling begins to bear
them toward power, they believe that he has
been all along right and the rest of the world
wrong. When victory at last settles on his crest,
even his enemies can hardly help applauding a
reward which seems so amply earned. It was
by this quality, more perhaps than by anything
else, by this serene surface with fathomless depths
below, that he laid his spell upon the imagination
of observers in Continental Europe, and received
at his death a sort of canonisation from a large
section of the English people.</p>
<p>What will posterity think of him, and by
what will he be remembered? The glamour has
already passed away, and to few of those who on
the 19th of April deck his statue with flowers
is he more than a name.</p>
<p>Parliamentary fame is fleeting: the memory of
parliamentary conflicts soon grows dim and dull.
Posterity fixes a man&rsquo;s place in history by asking
not how many tongues buzzed about him in his
lifetime, but how great a factor he was in the
changes of the world, that is, how far different
things would have been twenty or fifty years
after his death if he had never lived. Tried by
this standard, the results upon the course of events
of Disraeli&rsquo;s personal action are not numerous,
though some of them may be deemed momentous.
He was an adroit parliamentary tactician who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
held his followers together through a difficult
time. By helping to keep the Peelites from
rejoining their old party, he gave that party a
colour different from the sober hues which it
had worn during the leadership of Peel. He
became the founder of what has in later days
been called Tory democracy, winning over a
large section of the humbler classes to the
banner under which the majority of the wealthy
and the holders of vested interests already stood
arrayed. He saved for the Turkish Empire
a part of its territories, yet in doing so merely
prolonged for a little the death agony of
Turkish power. Though it cannot be said
that he conferred any benefit on India or the
Colonies, he certainly stimulated the imperial
instincts of Englishmen. He had occasional
flashes of insight, as when in 1843 he perceived
exactly what Ireland needed, and at least one
brilliant flash of foresight when he predicted that
a wide extension of the suffrage would bring no
evil to the Tory party. Yet in the case of
Ireland he did nothing, when the chance came
to him, to give effect to the judgment which he
had formed, while in the case of the suffrage he
did but follow up and carry into effect an impulse
given by others. The Franchise Act of 1867 is
perhaps the only part of his policy which has,
by hastening a change that induced other changes,
permanently affected the course of events; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
it remains the chief monument of his parliamentary
skill. There was nothing in his career to
set the example of a lofty soul or a noble purpose.
He did not raise, he may even have lowered,
the tone of English public life.</p>
<p>Yet history will not leave him without a meed
of admiration. When all possible explanations of
his success have been given, what a wonderful
career! An adventurer foreign in race, in
ideas, in temper, without money or family
connections, climbs, by patient and unaided
efforts, to lead a great party, master a powerful
aristocracy, sway a vast empire, and make himself
one of the four or five greatest personal
forces in the world. His head is not turned by
his elevation. He never becomes a demagogue;
he never stoops to beguile the multitude by
appealing to sordid instincts. He retains through
life a certain amplitude of view, a due sense of
the dignity of his position, a due regard for the
traditions of the ancient assembly which he leads,
and when at last the destinies of England fall
into his hands, he feels the grandeur of the
charge, and seeks to secure what he believes to
be her imperial place in the world. Whatever
judgment history may ultimately pass upon
him, she will find in the long annals of the
English Parliament no more striking figure.</p>

<h2>DEAN STANLEY<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor2">[16]</a></h2>
</div>
<p>In the England of his time there was no personality
more attractive, nor any more characteristic of
the country, than Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, Dean
of Westminster. England is the only European
country in which such a figure could have appeared,
for it is the only country in which a man may hold
a high ecclesiastical post and yet be regarded
by the nation, not specially as an ecclesiastic, but
rather as a distinguished writer, an active and
influential man of affairs, an ornament of social
life. But if in this respect he was typical of his
country, he was in other respects unique. He
was a clergyman untouched by clericalism, a
courtier unspoiled by courts. No one could
point to any one else in England who occupied
a similar position, nor has any one since arisen
who recalls him, or who fills the place which his
departure left empty.</p>
<p>Stanley was born in 1815. His father, then
Rector of Alderley, in Cheshire, afterwards Bishop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
of Norwich, belonged to the family of the Stanleys
of Alderley, a branch of that ancient and famous
line the head of which is Earl of Derby. His
mother, Catherine Leycester, was a woman of
much force of character and intellectual power.
He was educated at Rugby School under Dr.
Arnold, the influence of whose ideas remained
great over him all through his life, and at
Oxford, where he became a fellow and tutor
of University College. Passing thence to be
Canon of Canterbury, he returned to the University
as Professor of Ecclesiastical History,
and remained there for seven years. In 1863
he was appointed Dean of Westminster, and at
the same time married Lady Augusta Bruce
(sister of the then Lord Elgin, Governor-General
first of Canada and afterwards of India). He
died in 1881.</p>
<p>He had an extraordinarily active and busy life,
so intertwined with the history of the University of
Oxford and the history of the Church of England
from 1850 to 1880, that one can hardly think of any
salient point in either without thinking also of
him. Yet it was perhaps rather in the intensity
of his nature and the nobility of his sentiments
than in either the compass or the strength of his
intellectual faculties that the charm and the force
he exercised lay. In some directions he was
curiously deficient. He had no turn for abstract
reasoning, no liking for metaphysics or any other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
form of speculation. He was equally unfitted
for scientific inquiry, and could scarcely work
a sum in arithmetic. Indeed, in no field was
he a logical or systematic thinker. Neither,
although he had a retentive memory, and
possessed a great deal of various knowledge on
many subjects, could he be called learned, for
he had not really mastered any branch of history,
and was often inaccurate in details. He had never
been trained to observe facts in natural history.
He had absolutely no ear for music, and very
little perception either of colour or of scent. He
learned foreign languages with difficulty and never
spoke them well. He was so short-sighted as to
be unable to recognise a face passing close in the
street. Yet with these shortcomings he was a
born traveller, went everywhere, saw everything
and everybody worth seeing, always seized on
the most characteristic features of a landscape, or
building, or a person, and described them with a
freshness which made one feel as if they had
never been described before. Of the hundreds
who have published books on the Desert of
Sinai and the Holy Land, many of them skilful
writers or men of profound knowledge, he is
the only one who is still read and likely to continue
to be read, so vivid in colour, so exquisite
in feeling, are the pictures he has given. Nature
alone, however, nature taken by herself, did not
satisfy him, did not, indeed, in his later days (for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
in his boyhood he had been a passionate lover of
the mountains) greatly interest him. A building
or a landscape had power to rouse his imagination
and call forth his unrivalled powers of description
only when it was associated with the
thoughts and deeds of men.</p>
<p>The largest part of his literary work was done
in the field of ecclesiastical history, a subject
naturally congenial to him, and to which he was
further drawn by the professorship which he held
at Oxford during a time when a great revival of
historical studies was in progress. It was work
which critics could easily disparage, for there were
many small errors scattered through it; and the
picturesque method of treatment he employed
was apt to pass into scrappiness. He fixed on
the points which had a special interest for his
own mind as illustrating some trait of personal
or national character, or some moral lesson, and
passed hastily over other matters of equal or
greater importance. Nevertheless his work
had some distinctive merits which have not received
from professional critics the whole credit
they deserved. In all that Stanley wrote one
finds a certain largeness and dignity of view.
He had a sense of the unity of history, of the
constant relation of past and present, of the similarity
of human nature in one age and country to
human nature in another; and he never failed to
dwell upon the permanently valuable truths which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
history has to teach. Nothing was too small to
attract him, because he discovered a meaning in
everything, and he was therefore never dull,
for even when he moralised he would light up
his reflections by some happy anecdote. With
this he possessed a keen eye, the eye of a
poet, for human character, and a power of
sympathy that enabled him to appreciate even
those whose principles and policy he disliked.
Herein he was not singular, for the sympathetic
style of writing history has become fashionable
among us. What was remarkable in him was
that his sympathy did not betray him into the
error, now also fashionable, of extenuating moral
distinctions. His charity never blunted the edge
of his justice, nor prevented him from reprobating
the faults of the personages who had touched his
heart. For one sin only he had little historical
tolerance&mdash;the sin of intolerance. So there was
one sin only which ever led him to speak severely
of any of his contemporaries&mdash;the sin of untruthfulness.
Being himself so simple and straightforward
as to feel his inability to cope with
deceitful men, deceit incensed him. But he did not
resent the violence of his adversaries, for though
he suffered much at their hands he knew many
of them to be earnest, unselfish, and conscientious
men.</p>
<p>His pictures of historical scenes are admirable,
for with his interest in the study of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
character there went a large measure of dramatic
power. Nothing can be better in its way
than the description of the murder of St.
Thomas of Canterbury given in the <i>Memorials
of Canterbury</i>, which, after <i>Sinai and Palestine</i>
and the <i>Life of Arnold</i>, may be deemed
the best of Stanley&rsquo;s books. Whether he
could, with more leisure for careful thought
and study, have become a great historian, was
a question which those of us who were dazzled
by his Public Lectures at Oxford used often
to discuss. The leisure never came, for he
was throughout life warmly interested in every
current ecclesiastical question, and ready to
bear a part in discussing it, either in the
press&mdash;for he wrote in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>,
and often sent letters to the <i>Times</i> under
the signature of &ldquo;Anglicanus&rdquo;&mdash;or in Convocation,
where he had a seat during the latter
part of his career. These interruptions not
only checked the progress of his studies, but
gave to his compositions an air of haste, which
made them seem to want system and finish. The
habit of rapid writing for magazines or other
ephemeral purposes is alleged to tell injuriously
upon literary men: it told the more upon Stanley
because he was also compelled to produce sermons
rapidly. Now sermon-writing, while it breeds a
tendency to the making of rhetorical points, subordinates
the habit of dispassionate inquiry to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
enforcement of a moral lesson. Stanley, who
had a touch of the rhetorical temperament, and
was always eager to improve an occasion, certainly
suffered in this way. When he brings out a general
truth he is not content with it as a truth, but
seeks to turn it also to edification, or to make
it illustrate and support some view for which he
is contending at the time. When he is simply
describing, he describes rather as a dramatic artist
working for effect than as a historian solely
anxious to represent men and events as they
were. Yet if we consider how much a historian
gains, not only from an intimate knowledge of
his own time, but also, and even more
largely, from playing an active part in the
events of his own time, from swaying opinion by
his writings and his speeches, from sitting in
assemblies and organising schemes of attack and
defence, we may hesitate to wish that Stanley&rsquo;s
time had been more exclusively given to quiet
investigation. The freshness of his historical
portraits is notably due to the sense he carried
about with him of moving in history and being
a part of it. He never mounted his pulpit
in the Abbey or walked into the Jerusalem
Chamber when Convocation was sitting without
feeling that he was about to do something which
might possibly be recorded in the annals of his
country. I remember his mentioning, to illustrate
undergraduate ignorance, that once when he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
going to give a lecture to his class, he suddenly
recollected that Mr. Goldwin Smith, then Regius
Professor of Modern History, was announced to
deliver a public lecture at the same hour. Telling
the class that they would be better employed in
hearing Mr. Goldwin Smith than himself, he led
them all there. The next time the class met,
one of them, after making some acute comments
on the lecture, asked who the lecturer was. &ldquo;I
was amazed,&rdquo; said Stanley, &ldquo;that an intelligent
man should ask such a question, and then it
occurred to me that probably he did not know
who I was either.&rdquo; There was nothing of personal
vanity or self-importance in this. All the
men of mark among whom he moved were to him
historical personages, and he would describe to
his friends some doing or saying of a contemporary
statesman or ecclesiastic with the same
eagerness, the same sense of its being a fact to
be noted and remembered, as the rest of us feel
about a personal anecdote relating to Oliver
Cromwell or Cardinal Richelieu.</p>
<p>His sermons, like nearly all good sermons, will
be inadequately appreciated by those who now
peruse them, not only because they were composed
for a given audience with special reference to the
circumstances of the time, but also because the
best of them gained so much by his impassioned
delivery. They were all read from manuscript, and
his handwriting was so illegible that it was a marvel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
how he contrived to read them. I once asked
him, not long after he had been promoted to the
Deanery of Westminster, whether he found it
easy to make himself heard in the enormous nave
of the Abbey church. His frame, it ought to
be stated, was spare as well as small, and his
voice not powerful. He answered: &ldquo;That depends
on whether I am interested in what I
am saying. If the sermon is on something
which interests me deeply I can fill the nave;
otherwise I cannot.&rdquo; When he had got a worthy
theme, or one which stimulated his own emotions,
the power of his voice and manner was wonderful.
His tiny body seemed to swell, his chest
vibrated as he launched forth glowing words.
The farewell sermon he delivered when quitting
Oxford for Westminster lives in the memory of
those who heard it as a performance of extraordinary
power, the power springing from the
intensity of his own feeling. No sermon has
ever since so moved the University.</p>
<p>He was by nature shy and almost timid, and he
was not supposed to possess any gift for extempore
speaking. But when in his later days he found
himself an almost solitary champion in Convocation
of the principles of universal toleration and
comprehension which he held, he developed a debating
power which surprised himself as well as
his friends. It was to him a matter of honour and
conscience to defend his principles, and to defend
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
them all the more zealously because he stood
alone on their behalf in a hostile assembly. His
courage was equal to the occasion, and his faculties
responded to the call his courage made.</p>
<p>In civil politics he was all his life a Liberal, belonging
by birth to the Whig aristocracy, and disposed
on most matters to take rather the Whiggish
than the Radical view, yet drawn by the warmth
of his sympathy towards the working classes,
and popular with them. One of his chief
pleasures was to lead parties of humble visitors
round the Abbey on public holidays. Like most
members of the Whig families, he had no great
liking for Mr. Gladstone, not so much, perhaps,
on political grounds as because he distrusted the
High Churchism and anti-Erastianism of the
Liberal leader. However, he never took any
active part in general politics, reserving his
strength for those ecclesiastical questions which
seemed to lie within his peculiar province.<a name='FNanchor_0015' id='FNanchor_0015'></a><a href='#Footnote_0015' class='fnanchor'>[17]</a>
Here he had two leading ideas: one, that the
Church of England must at all hazards continue
to be an Established Church, in alliance with, or
subjection to, the State (for his Erastianism was
unqualified), and recognising the Crown as her
head; the other, that she must be a comprehensive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
Church, finding room in her bosom for
every sort or description of Christian, however
much or little he believed of the dogmas contained
in the Thirty-nine Articles and the Prayer-Book,
to which she is bound by statute. The
former view cut him off from the Nonconformists
and the Radicals; the latter exposed him to the fire
not only of those who, like the High Churchmen
and the Evangelicals, attach the utmost importance
to these dogmas, but of those also among
the laity who hold that a man ought under no
circumstances to sign any test or use any form of
prayer which does not express his own convictions.
Stanley would, of course, have greatly preferred
that the laws which regulate the Church of England
should be so relaxed as to require little or
no assent to any doctrinal propositions from her
ministers. He strove for this; and he continued
to hope that this might be ultimately won. But
he conceived that in the meantime it was a less
evil that men should be technically bound by
subscriptions they objected to than that the
National Church should be narrowed by the
exclusion of those whose belief fell short of her
dogmatic standards. It was remarkable that
not only did he maintain this unpopular view of
his with unshaken courage on every occasion,
pleading the cause of every supposed heretic
against hostile majorities with a complete forgetfulness
of his own peace and ease, but that no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
one ever thought of attributing the course he
took to any selfish or sinister motive. It was
generally believed that his own opinions were
what nine-tenths of the Church of England would
call unorthodox. But the honesty and uprightness
of his character were so patent that nobody
supposed that this fact made any difference, or
that it was for the sake of keeping his own place
that he fought the cause of others.</p>
<p>What his theological opinions were it might
have puzzled Stanley himself to explain. His
mind was not fitted to grasp abstract propositions.
His historical imagination and his early
associations attached him to the doctrines of the
Nicene Creed; but when he came to talk of
Christianity, he laid so much more stress on
its ethics than on its dogmatic side that his
clerical antagonists thought he held no creed at
all. Dr. Pusey once said that he and Stanley did
not worship the same God. The point of difference
between him and them was not so much that he
consciously disbelieved the dogmas they held&mdash;probably
he did not&mdash;as that he did not, like them,
think that true religion and final salvation depended
on believing them. And the weak point in his
imagination was that he seemed never to understand
their position, nor to realise how sacred and
how momentous to them were statements which
he saw in a purely imaginative light. He never
could be got to see that a Church without any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
dogmas would not be a Church at all in the sense
either of mankind in the past or of mankind in
the present. An anecdote was current that once
when he had in Disraeli&rsquo;s presence been descanting
on the harm done by the enforcement of dogmatic
standards, Disraeli had observed, &ldquo;But pray
remember, Mr. Dean, no dogma, no Dean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who thought him a heathen would have
assailed him less bitterly if he had been content
to admit his own differences from them. What
most incensed them was his habit of assuming
that, except in mere forms of expression, there
were really no differences at all, and that they
also held Christianity to consist not in any body
of doctrines, but in reverence for God and purity
of life. They would have preferred heathenism
itself to this kind of Universalism.</p>
<p>As ecclesiastical preferment had not discoloured
the native hue of his simplicity, so neither did the
influences of royal favour. It says little for
human nature that few people should be proof
against what the philosopher deems the trivial
and fleeting fascinations of a court. Stanley&rsquo;s
elevation of mind was proof. Intensely interested
in the knowledge of events passing behind the
scenes which his relations with the reigning family
opened to him, he scarcely ever referred to those
relations, and seemed neither to be affected
thereby, nor to care a whit more for the pomps
and vanities of power or wealth, a whit less for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
the friends and the causes he had learned to value
in his youth.</p>
<p>In private, that which most struck one in his
intellect was the quick eagerness with which his
imagination fastened upon any new fact, caught
its bearings, and clothed it with colour. His
curiosity remained inexhaustible. His delight in
visiting a new country was like that of an
American scholar landing for the first time in
Europe. A friend met him a year before his
death at a hotel in the North of England,
and found he was going to the Isle of Man.
He had mastered its geography and history,
and talked about it and what he was to
explore there as one might talk of Rome or
Athens when visiting them for the first time.
When anybody told him an anecdote his susceptible
imagination seized upon points which the
narrator had scarcely noticed, and discovered a
whole group of curious analogies from other times
or countries. Whatever you planted in this fertile
soil struck root and sprouted at once. Morally,
he impressed those who knew him not only by
his kindness of heart, but by a remarkable
purity and nobleness of aim. Nothing mean or
small or selfish seemed to harbour in his mind.
You might think him right or wrong, but you
never doubted that he was striving after the
truth. He was not merely a just man; he
loved justice with passion. It was partly, perhaps,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
because justice, goodness, honour, charity,
seemed to him of such paramount importance in
life that he made little of doctrinal differences,
having perceived that these virtues may exist, and
may also be found wanting, in every form of
religious creed or philosophical profession. When
the Convocation of the Anglican Church met at
Westminster, it was during many years his habit
to invite a great number of its leading members to
the deanery, the very men who had been attacking
him most hotly in debate, and who would
go on denouncing his latitudinarianism till Convocation
met again. They yielded&mdash;sometimes
reluctantly, but still they yielded&mdash;to the kindliness
of his nature and the charm of his
manner. He used to dart about among them,
introducing opponents to one another, as indeed
on all occasions he delighted to bring the most
diverse people together, so that some one said
the company you met at the deanery were either
statesmen and duchesses or starving curates and
briefless barristers.</p>
<p>He had on the whole a happy life. It is
true that the intensity of his attachments exposed
him to correspondingly intense grief when he
lost those who were dearest to him; true also
that, being by temperament a man of peace, he
was during the latter half of his life almost constantly
at war. But his home, first in the lifetime
of his mother and then in that of his wife, had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
a serene and unclouded brightness; and the care
of the Abbey, rich with the associations of nearly
a thousand years of history, provided a function
which exactly suited him and which constituted
a never-failing source of enjoyment. To dwell in
the centre of the life of the Church of England,
and to dwell close to the Houses of Parliament,
in the midst of the making of history, knowing
and seeing those who were principally concerned
in making it, was in itself a pleasure to his
quenchless historical curiosity. His cheerfulness
and animation, although to some extent revived
by his visit to America and the reception he met
with there, were never the same after his wife&rsquo;s
death in 1876. But the sweetness of his disposition
and his affection for his friends knew
no diminution. He remembered everything that
concerned them; was always ready with sympathy
in sorrow or joy; and gave to all alike,
high or low, famous or unknown, the same impression,
that his friendship was for themselves,
and not for any gifts or rank or other worldly
advantage they might enjoy. The art of friendship
is the greatest art in life. To enjoy his was
to be educated in that art.</p>

<h2>THOMAS HILL GREEN</h2>
</div>
<p>The name of Thomas Green, Professor of Moral
Philosophy in the University of Oxford, was not,
during his lifetime, widely known outside the
University itself. But he is still remembered by
students of metaphysics and ethics as one of the
most vigorous thinkers of his time; and his personality
was a striking one, which made a deep
and lasting impression on those with whom he
came in contact.</p>
<p>He was born in Yorkshire in 1836, the son
of a country clergyman; was educated at Rugby
School and at Balliol College, Oxford, of which
he became a fellow in 1860, and a tutor in 1869.
In 1867 he was an unsuccessful candidate for a
chair of philosophy at St. Andrews, and in 1878
was elected Professor of Moral Philosophy in his
own University, which he never thereafter quitted.
He was married in 1869 and died in 1882. It
was a life externally uneventful, but full of
thought and work, and latterly crowned by great
influence over the younger and great respect from
the senior members of the University.</p>
<p>I can best describe Green as he was in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
undergraduate days, for it was then that I saw
most of him. His appearance was striking,
and made him a familiar figure even to those
who did not know him personally. Thick
black hair, a sallow complexion, dark eyebrows,
deep-set eyes of rich brown with a peculiarly
steadfast look, were the features which first
struck one; and with these there was a remarkable
seriousness of expression, an air of
solidity and quiet strength. He knew comparatively
few people, and of these only a very few
intimately, having no taste or turn for those
sports in which university acquaintances are most
frequently made, and seldom appearing at breakfast
or wine parties. This caused him to pass
for harsh or unsocial; and I remember having
felt a slight sense of alarm the first time I found
myself seated beside him. Though we belonged
to different colleges I had heard a great deal
about him, for Oxford undergraduates are warmly
interested in one another, and at the time I am
recalling they had an inordinate fondness for
measuring the intellectual gifts and conjecturing
the future of those among their contemporaries
who seemed likely to attain eminence.</p>
<p>Those who came to know Green intimately,
soon perceived that under his reserve there
lay not only a capacity for affection&mdash;no
man was more tenacious in his friendships&mdash;but
qualities that made him an attractive companion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
His tendency to solitude sprang less
from pride or coldness, than from the occupation
of his mind by subjects which seldom weigh on
men of his age. He had, even when a boy
at school (where he lived much by himself, but
exercised considerable moral influence), been
grappling with the problems of metaphysics and
theology, and they had given a tinge of gravity
to his manner. The relief to that gravity lay in
his humour, which was not only abundant but
genial and sympathetic. It used to remind us
of Carlyle&mdash;he had both the sense of humour
and an underlying Puritanism in common with
Carlyle, one of the authors who (with Milton
and Wordsworth) had most influenced him&mdash;but
in Green the Puritan tinge was more kindly,
and, above all, more lenient to ordinary people.
While averse, perhaps too severely averse, to
whatever was luxurious or frivolous in undergraduate
life, he had the warmest interest in, and
the strongest sympathy for, the humbler classes.
Loving social equality, and filled with a sense of
the dignity of simple human nature, he liked to
meet farmers and tradespeople on their own level,
and knew how to do so without seeming to condescend;
indeed nothing pleased him better, than
when they addressed him as one of themselves,
the manner of his talk to them, as well as the
extreme plainness of his dress, conducing to such
mistakes. The belief in the duty of approaching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
the people directly and getting them to think and
to form and express their own views in their own
way was at the root of all his political doctrines.</p>
<p>Though apt to be silent in general company,
no one could be more agreeable when
you were alone with him. We used to say
of him&mdash;and his seniors said the same&mdash;that
one never talked to him without carrying
away something to ponder over. On everything
he said or wrote there was stamped the
impress of a strong individuality, a mind that
thought for itself, a character ruggedly original,
wherein grimness was mingled with humour, and
practical shrewdness with a love for abstract
speculation. His independence appeared even in
the way he pursued his studies. With abilities of
the highest order, he cared comparatively little
for the distinctions which the University offers;
choosing rather to follow out his own line of
reading in the way he judged permanently useful
than to devote himself to the pursuit of honours
and prizes.</p>
<p>He was constitutionally lethargic, found it hard
to rouse himself to exertion, and was apt to let
himself be driven to the last moment in finishing
a piece of work. There was a rule in his College
that an essay should be given in every Friday
evening. His was, to the great annoyance of
the dons, never ready till Saturday. But when
it did go in, it was the weightiest and most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
thoughtful, as well as the most eloquent, that the
College produced. This indolence had one good
result. It disposed him to brood over subjects,
while others were running quickly through many
books and getting up subjects for examination.
It contributed to that depth and systematic
quality which struck us in his thinking, and
made him seem mature beside even the ablest
of his contemporaries. When others were
being, so to speak, blown hither and thither,
picking up and fascinated by new ideas, which
they did not know how to fit in with their old
ones, he seemed to have already formed for himself,
at least in outline, a scheme of philosophy and
life coherent and complete. There was nothing
random or scattered in his ideas; his mind, like
his style of writing, which ran into long and complicated
sentences, had a singular connectedness.
You felt that all its principles were in relation with
one another. This maturity in his mental attitude
gave him an air of superiority, just as the
strength of his convictions gave a dogmatic quality
to his deliverances. Yet in spite of positiveness
and tenacity he had the saving grace of a humility
which distrusted human nature in himself at least
as much as he distrusted it in others. Leading
an introspective life, he had many &ldquo;wrestlings,&rdquo;
and often seemed conscious of the struggle between
the natural man and the spiritual man, as
described in the Epistle to the Romans.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></div>
<p>In these early days, before, and to a less
extent after, taking his degree, he used to
speak a good deal, mostly on political topics,
at the University Debating Society, where so
many generations of young men have sharpened
their wits upon one another. His speaking
was vigorous, shrewd, and full of matter, yet
it could not be called popular. It was, in a
certain sense, too good for a debating society,
too serious, and without the dash and sparkle
which tell upon audiences of that kind. Sometimes,
however, and notably in a debate on the
American War of Secession in 1863, he produced,
by the concentrated energy of his language and
the fierce conviction with which he spoke, a
powerful effect.<a name='FNanchor_0016' id='FNanchor_0016'></a><a href='#Footnote_0016' class='fnanchor'>[18]</a> In a business assembly, discussing
practical questions, he would soon have
become prominent, and would have been capable
on occasions of an oratorical success.</p>
<p>Retired as was Green&rsquo;s life, he became by
degrees more and more widely known beyond the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
circle of his own intimates; and became also, I
think, more willing to make new friends. His
truthfulness appeared in this that, though powerful
in argument, he did not argue for victory.
When he felt the force of what was urged against
him, his admissions were candid. Thus people
came to respect his character, with its high sense
of duty, its simplicity, its uprightness, its earnest
devotion to an ideal, even more than they admired
his intellectual powers. I remember one friend of
my own, himself eminent in undergraduate Oxford,
and belonging to another college, between which
and Green&rsquo;s there existed much rivalry, who,
having been defeated by Green in competition
for a University prize, said, &ldquo;If it had been
any one else, I should have been vexed, but I
don&rsquo;t mind being beaten by a man I respect so
much.&rdquo; My friend knew Green very slightly,
and had been at one time strongly prejudiced
against him by rumours of his heterodox opinions.</p>
<p>So much for those undergraduate days on
which recollection loves to dwell, but which were
not days of unmixed happiness to Green, for his
means were narrow and the future rose cloudy
before him. When anxiety was removed by the
income which a fellowship secured, he still hesitated
as to his course in life. At one time he
thought of journalism, or of seeking a post in the
Education Office. More frequently his thoughts
turned to the clerical profession. His theological
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
opinions would not have permitted him to enter
the service of the Church of England, but he
did seriously consider whether he should become
a Unitarian minister. It was not till he found
that his college needed him as a teacher that
these difficulties came to an end. Similarly he
had doubted whether to devote himself to history,
to theology, or to metaphysics. For history
he had unquestionable gifts. With no exceptional
capacity for mastering or retaining facts,
he had a remarkable power of penetrating at once
to the dominant facts, of grasping their connection,
and working out their consequences. He had also
a keen sense of the dramatic aspect of events, and
a turn, not unlike Carlyle&rsquo;s, partly perhaps formed
on Carlyle, of fastening on the details in which
character shows itself, and illumining narrative by
personal touches. On the problems of theology
he had meditated even at school, and after taking
his degree he set himself to a systematic study of
the German critics, and I remember that when
we were living together at Heidelberg he had
begun to prepare a translation of C. F. Baur&rsquo;s
principal treatise. As he worked slowly, the translation
was never finished. Though not professing
to be an adherent of the T&uuml;bingen school,
he had been fascinated by Baur&rsquo;s ingenuity and
constructive power.</p>
<p>Ultimately he settled down to metaphysical
and ethical inquiries, and devoted to these the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
last thirteen years of his life. During his undergraduate
years the two intellectual forces most
powerful at Oxford had been the writings of
J. H. Newman in the religious sphere, though
their influence was already past its meridian, and
the writings of John Stuart Mill in the sphere
of logic and philosophy. By neither of these,
save in the way of antagonism, had Green been
influenced. He heartily hated all the Utilitarian
school, and had an especial scorn for Buckle, who,
now almost forgotten, enjoyed in those days, as
being supposed to be a philosophic historian, a brief
term of popularity. Green had been led by Carlyle
to the Germans, and his philosophic thinking was
determined chiefly by Kant and Hegel, more
perhaps by the former than by the latter, for it
was always upon ethical rather than upon purely
metaphysical problems that his mind was bent.
His religious vein and his hold upon practical
life made him more interested in morals than
in abstract speculation. Thus he became the
leader in Oxford of a new philosophic school
which looked to Kant as its master, and which
for a time, partly perhaps because it effectively
attacked the school of Mill, received the adhesion
of some among the most thoughtful of the younger
High Churchmen. Like Kant, he set himself to
answer David Hume, and the essay prefixed to
his edition of Hume&rsquo;s <i>Treatise on Human Nature</i>.
along with his <i>Prolegomena to Ethics</i>, are the only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
books in which his doctrines have been given to
the world, for he did not live to write the more
systematic exposition he had planned. These
two essays are hard reading, for his philosophical
style was usually technical, and sometimes verged
on obscurity. But when he wrote on less abstruse
matters he was intelligible as well as weighty, full
of thought, and with an occasional underglow
of restrained eloquence. The force of character
and convictions makes itself felt through the
language.</p>
<p>His mind, though constructive, was not, having
regard to its general power, either fertile or
versatile. Like most of those who prefer solitary
musings to the commerce of men, he had little
facility, and found it hard to express his thoughts
in any other words than those into which his
musings had first flowed. Thus even his oral
teaching was not easy to follow. An anecdote was
current how when one day he had been explaining
to a small class his theory of the origin of our
ideas, the class listened in rapt attention to
his forcible rhetoric, admiring each sentence as
it fell, and thinking that all their difficulties
were being removed. When he ended they
expressed their gratitude for the pleasure he
had given them, and were quitting the room,
when one, halting at the door, said timidly,
&ldquo;But, Mr. Green, what did you say was really
the origin of our ideas?&rdquo; However, whether
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
they were or were not capable of assimilating
his doctrines, his pupils all joined in their respect
for him. They felt the loftiness of his character,
they recognised the fervour of his belief. He
was the most powerful ethical influence, and
perhaps also the most stimulative intellectual
influence, that in those years played upon the
minds of the ablest youth of the University.
But it was a singular fact, which those who
have never lived in Oxford or Cambridge may
find it hard to understand, that when he rose
from the post of a college tutor to that of a
University professor, his influence declined, not
that his powers or his earnestness waned, but
because as a professor he had fewer auditors
and less personal relation with them than he
had commanded as a college teacher. Such is
the working of the collegiate system in Oxford,
curiously unfortunate when it deprives the ablest
men, as they rise naturally to the highest positions,
of the opportunities for usefulness they had previously
enjoyed.</p>
<p>As his powers developed and came to be
recognised, so did those slight asperities which
had been observed in undergraduate days soften
down and disappear. Though he lived a retired
life, his work brought him into contact with
a good many people, and he became more
genial in general company. I remember his
saying with a smile when I had lured him into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
Wales for a short excursion, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
whether it is a sign of declining virtue, but I find
as I grow older that I am less and less fond of
my own company.&rdquo; From the first he had won
the confidence and affection of his pupils. Many of
them used long afterwards to say that his conduct
and his teaching had been the one great example
or one great influence they had found and felt in
Oxford. The unclouded happiness of his married
life made it easier for him to see the bright side of
things, and he could not but enjoy the sense that
the seed he sowed was falling on ground fit to
receive it. Even when ill-health had fastened
on him, and was checking both his studies and
his public work, it did not affect the evenness of
his temper nor sharpen the edge of his judgments
of others. In earlier days these had been sometimes
austere, though expressed in temperate and
measured terms.</p>
<p>I must not forget to add that although
Green&rsquo;s opinions were by no means orthodox, the
influence he exerted while he remained a college
tutor was in large measure a religious influence.
As the clergyman used to be in the English Universities
less of a clergyman than he was anywhere
else, so conversely it caused no surprise there that
a lay teacher should concern himself with the
religious life of his pupils. Green, however, did
more, for he on two occasions at least delivered
to his pupils, before the celebration of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
communion in the college chapel, addresses which
were afterwards privately printed, and which present
his view of the relations of ethics and religion
in a way impressive even to those who may find
it hard to follow the philosophical argument.</p>
<p>Metaphysicians are generally as little interested
in practical politics as poets are, and not better
suited for political life. Green was a remarkable
exception. Politics were in a certain sense the
strongest of his interests. To him metaphysics
were not only the basis of theology, but also the
basis of politics. Everything was to converge
on the free life of the individual in a free State;
rational faith and reason inspired by emotion
were to have their perfect work in making the
good citizen.</p>
<p>His interest in politics was perhaps less
active in later years than it had been in his
youth, but his principles stood unchanged. He
was a thoroughgoing Liberal, or what used to be
called a Radical, full of faith in the people, an
advocate of pretty nearly every measure that
tended to democratise English institutions, a
friend of peace and of non-intervention. In
our days he would have been called a Little
Englander, for though his ideal of national life
was lofty, the wellbeing of the masses was to
him a more essential part of that ideal than any
extension of territory or power. He once said
that he would rather see the flag of England
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
trailed in the dirt than add sixpence to the taxes
that weigh upon the poor. In foreign politics
Louis Napoleon, as the corrupter of France and
the disturber of Europe, was his favourite aversion;
in home politics, Lord Palmerston, as the
chief obstacle to parliamentary reform. The
statesman whom he most admired and trusted
was Mr. Bright. A strong sense of civic duty
led him to enter the City Council of Oxford,
although he could ill spare from his study and
his lecture-room the time which the discharge of
municipal duties required. He was the first tutor
who had ever offered himself to a ward for election.
The townsfolk, between whom and the University
there had generally been little love, the former
thinking themselves looked down upon by the
latter, warmly appreciated his action in coming
out of his seclusion to help them, and his influence
in the Council contributed to secure some useful
reforms, among others, the establishment of a
&ldquo;grammar&rdquo; or secondary school for the city.</p>
<p>One of the last things he wrote was a short
pamphlet on freedom of contract, intended to
justify the interference with bargains between
landlord and tenant which was proposed by Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s Irish Land Bill of 1881. It is a
vigorous piece of reasoning, which may still be
read with interest in respect of its application
of philosophical principles to a political controversy.
Had he desired it he might have gone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
to the House of Commons as member for the city
of Oxford. But he had found in the Council a
field for local public work, and apart from his
constitutional indolence and his declining health,
he had concluded that his first duty lay in expounding
his philosophical system.</p>
<p>Green will be long remembered in the English
Universities as the strongest force in the sphere
of ethical philosophy that they have seen in the
second half of the nineteenth century, and remembered
also as a singular instance of a metaphysician
with a bent towards politics and practical
life, no less than as a thinker far removed from
orthodoxy who exerted over orthodox Christians
a potent and inspiring religious influence.</p>

<p>England is now the only Protestant country in
which bishops retain some relics of the dignity
and influence which belonged to the episcopal
office during the Middle Ages. Even in Roman
Catholic countries they have been sadly shorn
of their ancient importance, though the prelates
of Hungary still hold vast possessions, while in
France, or Spain, or the Catholic parts of
Germany a man of eminent talents and energy
may occasionally use his official position to become,
through his influence over Catholic electors
or Catholic deputies, a considerable political
factor. This happens even in the United States
and Canada, though in the United States the
general feeling that religion must be kept out of
politics obliges ecclesiastics to use their spiritual
powers cautiously and sparingly. England stands
alone in the fact that although the Protestant
Episcopal Church is, in so far as she is established
by law, the creature and subject of the State,
she is nevertheless so far independent as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
religious organisation that she retains a greater
power than in other Protestant nations. State
establishment, though it may have depressed, has
not stifled her ecclesiastical life, and an interest
in ecclesiastical questions is shown by a larger
proportion of her laity than one finds in Germany
or the Scandinavian kingdoms. A man of shining
parts has, as an English bishop, a wide field of
action and influence open to him outside the
sphere of theology or of purely official duty. And
the opportunities of the position attain their maximum
when he reaches the primatial chair of
Canterbury, which is now the oldest and the most
dignified of all the metropolitan sees in countries
that have accepted the Reformation of the sixteenth
century.</p>
<p>Ever since there was a bishop at Canterbury
at all, that is to say, ever since the conversion of
the English began in the seventh century of our
era, the holder of that see has been the greatest
ecclesiastical personage in these islands, with a
recognised authority over all England, as well
as an influence and dignity to which, in the
Middle Ages, the Archbishops of Armagh and
St. Andrews (primates of the Irish and Scottish
Churches) practically bowed, even while refusing
to admit his legal supremacy. To be the most
highly placed and officially the most powerful
man in the churches of Britain, in days when
the Church was better organised, and in some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
ways stronger, than the State, meant a vast deal.
The successor of Augustine was often called a
Pope of his own world&mdash;that world of Britain
which lay apart from the larger world of the
European continent. Down to the Reformation,
the English primates possessed a power which
made some of them almost a match for the
English kings. Dunstan, Lanfranc, Anselm,
Thomas (Becket), Hubert, Stephen Langton,
Arundel, Warham, were among the foremost
statesmen of their time. After Henry VIII.&rsquo;s
breach with Rome, the Primate of England received
some access of dignity in becoming independent
of the Pope; but, in reality, the loss
of church power and church wealth which the
Reformation caused lowered his political importance.
In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
however, there were still some conspicuous and
influential prelates at Canterbury&mdash;Cranmer, Pole,
Whitgift, and Laud the best remembered among
them. After the Revolution of 1688, a time of
smaller men begins. The office retained its
dignity as the highest place open to a subject,
ranking above the Lord Chancellor or the Lord
President of the Council, but the Church of
England, having no fightings within, nor anything
to fear from without, was lapped in placid
ease, so it mattered comparatively little who her
chief pastor was.</p>
<p>Bishoprics were in those days regarded chiefly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
as pieces of rich preferment with which prime
ministers bought the support of powerful adherents.
But since the middle of the nineteenth
century, as the Anglican Church has become at
once more threatened and more energetic, as
more of the life of the nation has flowed into
her and round her, the office of a bishop
has risen in importance. People show more
interest in the appointments to be made, and
ministers have become proportionately careful
in making them. Bishops work harder and are
more in the public eye now than they were
eighty, or even fifty, years ago. They have
lost something of the antique dignity and social
consideration which they enjoyed. They no
longer wear wigs or ride in State coaches. They
may be seen in third-class railway carriages,
or sitting on the tops of omnibuses. But they
have gained by having countless opportunities
opened up to them for exerting influence in
philanthropic as well as in religious movements;
and the more zealous among them turn these
opportunities to excellent account.</p>
<p>Whatever is true of an ordinary bishop is true
<i>a fortiori</i> of the Archbishop of Canterbury. He
is still a great personage, but he is great in a new
way, with less of wealth and power but larger
opportunities of influence. He is also a kind
of Pope in a new way, because he is the central
figure of the Anglican communion over the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
whole world, with no legal jurisdiction outside
England (except in India), but far over-topping
all the prelates of that communion in the United
States or the British Colonies. Less deference is
paid to the office, considered simply as an office,
than it received in the Middle Ages, because
society and thought have been tinged by the
spirit of democratic equality, and people realise
that offices are only artificial creations, whose
occupants are human beings like themselves. But
if he is himself a man of ability and force, he may
make his headship of an ancient and venerated
church a vantage-ground whence to address the
nation as well as the members of his own communion.
He is sure of being listened to, which is
of itself no small matter in a country where many
voices are striving to make themselves heard at
the same time. The world takes his words into
consideration; the newspapers repeat them. His
position gives him easy access to the ministers of
the Crown, and implies a confidential intercourse
with the Crown itself. He is, or can be, &ldquo;in
touch&rdquo; with all the political figures who can in
any way influence the march of events, and is
able to enforce his views upon them. All his
conduct is watched by the nation; so that if it
is discreet, provident, animated by high and
consistent principle, he gets full credit for
whatever he does well, and acquires that influence
to which masses of men are eager to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
bow whenever they can persuade themselves
that it is deserved. During the first half of
the nineteenth century the English people was
becoming more interested in ecclesiastical and in
theological matters than it had been during the
century preceding. It grew by slow degrees
more inclined to observe ecclesiastical persons,
to read and think about theological subjects, to
reflect upon the relations which the Church
ought to bear to civil life and moral progress.
Thus a leader of the Church of England
became relatively a more important factor than
he had been a century ago, and an archbishop,
strong by his character, rectitude, and
powers of utterance, rose to occupy a more
influential, if not more conspicuous, position than
his predecessors in the days of the Georges had
done.</p>
<p>These changes naturally made the selection
of an archbishop a more delicate and troublesome
business than it was in those good old
days. Nobody then blamed a Prime Minister
for preferring an aspirant who had the support
of powerful political connections. Blameless in
life he must be: even the eighteenth century
demanded that from candidates for English, if
not, according to Dean Swift, for Irish sees.
If he was also a man of courtly grace and
dignity, and a finished scholar, so much the
better. If he was a man of piety, that also was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
well. By the time of Queen Victoria the possession
of piety and of gifts of speech had become
more important qualifications, but the main thing
was tactful moderation. Even in apostolic days
it was required that a bishop should rule his own
house well, and the Popes esteemed most saintly
have not always been the best, as the famous case
of Celestine the Fifth attests. An archbishop
must first and foremost be a discreet and guarded
man, expressing few opinions, and those not extreme
ones. His chief virtue came to be, if not
the purely negative one of offending no section by
expressing the distinctive views of any other, yet
that of swerving so little from the <i>via media</i> between
Rome and Geneva that neither the Tractarian
party, who began to be feared after 1837,
nor the pronounced Low Churchmen could claim
the Primate as disposed to favour their opinions.
In the case of ordinary bishops the plan could
be adopted, and has since the days of Lord
Palmerston been mostly followed, of giving every
party its turn, while choosing from every party
men of the safer sort. This method, however,
was less applicable to the See of Canterbury, for
a man on whose action much might turn could
not well be taken from any particular section.
The acts and words of a Primate, who is expected
to &ldquo;give a line&rdquo; to the clergy generally and to
speak on behalf of the bench of bishops as a
whole, are so closely scrutinised that he must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
be prudent and wary, yet not so wary as to seem
timid. He ought to be both firm and suave,
conciliatory and decided. That he may do
justice to all sections of the Church of England,
he ought not to be an avowed partisan
of any. Yet he must be able and eminent, and
of course able and eminent men are apt to throw
themselves into some one line of action or set
of views, and so come to be considered partisans.
The position which the Archbishop of Canterbury
holds as the representative in Parliament
of the whole Established Church, makes statesmanship
the most important of all qualifications.
Learning, energy, eloquence, piety would
none of them, nor all of them together, make
up for the want of calmness and wisdom. Yet
all those qualities are obviously desirable, because
they strengthen as well as adorn the primate&rsquo;s
position.</p>
<p>Archibald Campbell Tait (born in Scotland in
1811, died 1882) was educated at Glasgow University
and at Balliol College, Oxford; worked at
his college for some years as a tutor, succeeded
Dr. Arnold as headmaster of Rugby School in
1843, became Dean of Carlisle and then Bishop
of London, and was translated to Canterbury
in 1868. It has been generally understood that
Mr. Disraeli, then Prime Minister, suggested
another prelate for the post, but the Queen,
who did not share her minister&rsquo;s estimate of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
that prelate, expressed a preference for Tait.
Her choice was amply justified, for Tait united,
and indeed possessed in a high degree, the
qualifications which have just been enumerated.
He was, if it be not a paradox to say so, more
remarkable as an archbishop than as a man. He
had no original power as a thinker. He was
not a striking preacher, and the more pains he
took with his sermons the less interesting did they
become. He was so far from being learned that
you could say no more of him than that he was
a sound scholar and a well-informed man. He
was deeply and earnestly pious, but in a quiet,
almost dry way, which lacked what is called
unction, though it impressed those who were
in close contact with him. He showed slight
interest either in the historical or in the speculative
side of theology. Though a good headmaster,
he was not a stimulating teacher. Had
he remained all his life in a subordinate position,
as a college tutor at Oxford, or as canon of
some cathedral, he would have discharged the
duties of the position in a thoroughly satisfactory
way, and would have acquired influence
among his colleagues, but no one would have
felt that Fate had dealt unfairly with him in
depriving him of some larger career and loftier
post. No one, indeed, who knew him when he
was a college tutor seems to have predicted
the dignities he was destined to attain, although
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
he had shown in the theological strife that then
raged at Oxford the courage and independence
of his character.</p>
<p>In what, then, did the secret of his success
lie&mdash;the secret, that is, of his acquitting himself
so excellently in those dignities as to have
become almost a model to his own and the
next generation of what an Archbishop of Canterbury
ought to be? In the statesmanlike quality
of his mind. He had not merely moderation,
but what, though often confounded with moderation,
is something rarer and better, a steady
balance of mind. He was carried about by
no winds of doctrine. He seldom yielded to
impulses, and was never so seduced by any one
theory as to lose sight of other views and conditions
which had to be regarded. He was, I think,
the first man of Scottish birth who ever rose to
be Primate of England, and he had the cautious
self-restraint which is deemed characteristic of his
nation. He knew how to be dignified without
assumption, firm without vehemence, prudent
without timidity, judicious without coldness.
He was, above all things, a singularly just
man, who recognised every one&rsquo;s rights, and
did not seek to overbear them by an exercise
of authority. He was as ready to listen to his
opponents as to his friends. Indeed, he so held
himself as to appear to have no opponents, but
to be rather a judge before whom different
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
advocates were stating their respective cases,
than a leader seeking to make his own views
or his own party prevail. Genial he could
hardly be called, for there was little warmth,
little display of emotion, in his manner; and the
clergy noted, at least in his earlier episcopal
days, a touch of the headmaster in his way of
receiving them. But he was simple and kindly,
capable of seeing the humorous side of things,
desiring to believe the good rather than the
evil, and to lead people instead of driving them.
With all his caution he was direct and straightforward,
saying no more than was necessary,
but saying nothing he had occasion to be ashamed
of. He sometimes made mistakes, but they were
not mistakes of the heart, and, being free from
vanity or self-conceit, he was willing in his quiet
way to admit them and to alter his course accordingly.
So his character by degrees gained upon
the nation, and so even ecclesiastical partisanship,
proverbially more bitter than political,
because it springs from deeper wells of feeling,
grew to respect and spare him. The influence
he obtained went far to strengthen the position
of the Established Church, and to keep its
several parties from breaking out into more open
hostility with one another. He himself inclined
to what might be called a moderate Broad
Church attitude, leaning more to Evangelical
than to Tractarian or Romanising views in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
matters of doctrine. At one time the extreme
High Churchmen regarded him as an enemy.
But this unfriendliness had almost died away
when the death of his wife and his only son
(a young man of singularly winning character),
followed by his own long illness, stilled the voices
of criticism.</p>
<p>He exerted great influence in the House
of Lords by his tact, by his firmness of
character, and by the consistency of his public
course, as well as by powers of speech, which,
matured by long practice, had risen to a
high level. Without eloquence, without either
imagination or passion, which are the chief
elements in eloquence, he had a grave, weighty,
thoughtful style which impressed that fastidious
audience. His voice was strong and sonorous,
his diction plain yet pure and dignified, his
matter well considered. His thought moved
on a high plane; he spoke as one who fully
believed every word he said. The late Bishop
of Winchester, the famous Dr. Samuel Wilberforce,
was incomparably his superior not only
as a talker but as an orator, but no less inferior
in his power over the House of Lords, for
so little does rhetorical brilliance count in a
critical and practical assembly. Next to courage,
the quality which gains trust and regard in a
deliberative body is that which is familiarly
described when it is said of a man, &ldquo;You always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
know where to find him.&rdquo; Tait belonged to no
party. But his principles, though not rigid, were
fixed and settled; his words and votes were the
expression of his principles.</p>
<p>The presence of bishops in the House of
Lords is disapproved by some sections of English
opinion, and there are those among the temporal
peers who, quite apart from any political feeling,
are said to regard them with little favour. But
every one must admit that they have raised
and adorned the debates in that chamber.
Besides Tait and Wilberforce, two other prelates
of the same generation stood in the front
rank of speakers, Dr. Magee, whose wit and
fire would have found a more fitting theatre
in the House of Commons, and Dr. Thirlwall,
a scholar and historian whose massive intellect
and stately diction were too rarely used to raise
great political issues above the dust-storms of
party controversy.</p>
<p>Perhaps no Archbishop since the Revolution
of 1688 has exercised so much influence as Dr.
Tait, and certainly none within living memory
is so well entitled to be credited with a definite
ecclesiastical policy. His aim was to widen the
bounds of the Church of England, so far as the law
could, without evasion, be stretched for that purpose.
He bore a leading part in obtaining an Act of
Parliament which introduced a new and less strict
form of clerical subscription. He realised that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
Church of England can maintain her position
as a State Church only by adapting herself to
the movements of opinion, and accordingly he
voted for the Divorce Bill of 1859, and for the
Burials Bill, which relieved Dissenters from a
grievance that exposed the Established Church
to odium. The Irish Church Disestablishment
Bill of 1869 threw upon him, at the critical
moment when it went from the House of
Commons, where it had passed by a large
majority, to the House of Lords, where a still
larger majority was hostile, a duty delicate in
itself, and such as seldom falls to the lot of a
prelate. The Queen wrote to him suggesting
that he should endeavour to effect a compromise
between Mr. Gladstone, then head of the
Liberal Ministry, and the leading Tory peers
who were opposing the Bill. He conducted the
negotiation with tact and judgment, and succeeded
in securing good pecuniary terms for the Protestant
Episcopal Establishment. Though he
had joined in the Letter of the Bishops which
conveyed their strong disapproval of the book
called <i>Essays and Reviews</i> (whose supposed
heretical tendencies roused such a storm in
1861), and had thereby displeased his friends,
Temple (afterwards archbishop), Jowett, and
Stanley,<a name='FNanchor_0017' id='FNanchor_0017'></a><a href='#Footnote_0017' class='fnanchor'>[20]</a> he joined in the judgment of the Privy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
Council which in 1863 dismissed the charges
against the impugned Essayists. Despite his
advocacy of the Bill which in 1874 provided a
new procedure to be used against clergymen
transgressing the ritual prescribed by law, he
discouraged prosecutions, and did his utmost
to keep Ritualists as well as moderate Rationalists
within the pale of the Church of England.
He did not succeed&mdash;no one could have succeeded,
even though he had spoken with the
tongues of men and of angels&mdash;in stilling ecclesiastical
strife. The controversies of his days still
rage, though in a slightly different form. But
in refusing to yield to the pressure of any section,
in regarding the opinion of the laity rather than
that of the clergy, in keeping close to the law
yet giving it the widest possible interpretation,
he laid down the lines on which the Anglican
Established Church can best be defended and
upheld. That she will last, as an Establishment,
for any very long time, will hardly be
expected by those who mark the direction in
which thought tends to move all over the civilised
world. But Tait&rsquo;s policy and personality
have counted for something in prolonging the
time-honoured connection of the Anglican Church
with the English State.</p>
<p>Perhaps a doubtful service either to the Church
or to the State. Yet even those who regret
the connection, and who, surveying the long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
course of Christian history from the days of the
Emperor Constantine down to our own, believe
that the Christian Church would have been
spiritually purer and morally more effective had
she never become either the mistress or the
servant or the ally of the State, but relied on
her divine commission only, may wish that, when
the day arrives for the ancient bond to be unloosed,
it should be unloosed not through an embittered
political struggle, but because the general sentiment
of the nation, and primarily of religious
men throughout the nation, has come to approve
the change.</p>

<h2>ANTHONY TROLLOPE<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor2">[21]</a></h2>
</div>
<p>When Mr. Anthony Trollope died (December
11, 1882) at the age of sixty-seven, he was the
best known of our English writers of fiction,
and stood foremost among them if the double
test of real merit and wide popularity be applied.
Some writers, such as Wilkie Collins, may have
commanded a larger sale. One writer at least, Mr.
George Meredith, had produced work of far deeper
insight and higher imaginative power. But the
gifts of Mr. Meredith had then scarcely begun
to win recognition, and not one reader knew his
name for five who knew Trollope&rsquo;s. So Mr.
Thomas Hardy had published what many continue
to think his two best stories, but they had not
yet caught the eye of the general public. Mrs.
Oliphant, high as was the general level of her
work, and inexhaustible as her fertility appeared,
had not cut her name so deep upon the time
as Trollope did. Everything she did was good,
nothing superlatively good. No one placed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
Trollope in the first rank of creative novelists
beside Dickens or Thackeray, or beside George
Eliot, who had died two years before. But in
the second rank he stood high; and though
other novelists may have had as many readers
as he, none was in so many ways representative
of the general character and spirit
of English fiction. He had established his
reputation nearly thirty years before, when
Thackeray and Dickens were still in the fulness
of their fame; and had maintained it during
the zenith of George Eliot&rsquo;s. For more than
a generation his readers had come from the
best-educated classes as well as from those who
lack patience or taste for anything heavier
than a story of adventure. In this respect
he stood above Miss Braddon, Mrs. Henry
Wood, Ouida, and other heroines of the circulating
libraries, and also above such more
artistic or less sensational writers as William
Black, Walter Besant, James Payn, and Whyte
Melville. (The school of so-called realistic
fiction had scarcely begun to appear.) None
of these had, like Trollope, succeeded in making
their creations a part of the common thought of
cultivated Englishmen; none had, like him, given
us characters which we treat as typical men and
women, and discuss at a dinner-table as though
they were real people. Mrs. Proudie, for instance,
the Bishop of Barchester&rsquo;s wife, to take the most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
obvious instance (though not that most favourable
to Trollope, for he produced better portraits than
hers), or Archdeacon Grantly, was when Trollope
died as familiar a name to English men and
women between sixty and thirty years of age
as Wilkins Micawber, or Blanche Amory, or
Rosamond Lydgate. There was no other living
novelist of whose personages the same could be
said, and perhaps none since has attained this
particular kind of success.</p>
<p>Personally, Anthony Trollope was a bluff,
genial, hearty, vigorous man, typically English
in his face, his talk, his ideas, his tastes. His
large eyes, which looked larger behind his large
spectacles, were full of good-humoured life and
force; and though he was neither witty nor
brilliant in conversation, he was what is called
very good company, having travelled widely,
known all sorts of people, and formed views,
usually positive views, on all the subjects of
the day, views which he was prompt to declare
and maintain. There was not much novelty in
them&mdash;you were disappointed not to find so
clever a writer more original&mdash;but they were
worth listening to for their solid common-sense,
tending rather to commonplace sense, and you
enjoyed the ardour with which he threw himself
into a discussion. Though boisterous and
insistent in his talk, he was free from assumption
or conceit, and gave the impression of liking the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
world he lived in, and being satisfied with his
own place in it. Neither did one observe in him
that erratic turn which is commonly attributed to
literary men. He was a steady and regular worker,
who rose every morning between five and six to
turn out a certain quantity of copy for the printer
before breakfast, enjoying his work, and fond of
his own characters&mdash;indeed he declared that he
filled his mind with them and saw them moving
before him&mdash;yet composing a novel just as other
people might compose tables of statistics. These
methodical habits were to some extent due to his
training as a clerk in the Post Office, where he
spent the earlier half of his working life, having
retired in 1864. He did not neglect his duties
there, even when occupied in writing, and claimed
to have been the inventor of the pillar letter-box.
It was probably in his tours as an inspector of
postal deliveries that he obtained that knowledge
of rural life which gives reality to his pictures
of country society. He turned his Civil Service
experiences to account in some of his stories,
giving faithful and characteristic sketches, in
<i>The Three Clerks</i> and <i>The Small House at
Allington</i>, of different types of Government
officials, a class which is much more of a class in
England than it is in America, though less of
a class than it is in Germany or France. His
favourite amusement was hunting, as readers of
his novels know, and until his latest years he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
might have been seen, though a heavy weight,
following the hounds in Essex once or twice a
week.</p>
<p>When E. A. Freeman wrote a magazine
article denouncing the cruelty of field sports,
Trollope replied, defending the amusement he
loved. Some one said it was a collision of two
rough diamonds. But the end was that Freeman
invited Trollope to come and stay with him at
Wells, and they became great friends.</p>
<p>Like most of his literary contemporaries, he
was a politician, and indeed a pretty keen one.
He once contested in the Liberal interest&mdash;in
those days literary men were mostly Liberals&mdash;the
borough of Beverley in Yorkshire, a corrupt little
place, where bribery proved too strong for him.
It was thereafter disfranchised as a punishment
for its misdeeds; and his costly experiences doubtless
suggested the clever electioneering sketches
in the story of <i>Ralph the Heir</i>. Thackeray also
was once a Liberal candidate. He stood for the
city of Oxford, and the story was current there for
years afterwards how the freemen of the borough
(not an exemplary class of voters) rose to an unwonted
height of virtue by declaring that though
they did not understand his speeches or know
who he was, they would vote for him, expecting
nothing, because he was a friend of Mr. Neate&rsquo;s.
Trollope showed his continued interest in public
affairs by appearing on the platform at the great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
meeting in St. James&rsquo;s Hall in December 1876,
which was the beginning of a vehement party
struggle over the Eastern Question that only
ended at the general election of 1880. He was
a direct and forcible speaker, who would have
made his way had he entered Parliament. But
as he had no practical experience of politics
either in the House of Commons or as a working
member of a party organisation in a city where
contests are keen, the pictures of political life
which are so frequent in his later tales have
not much flavour of reality. They are sketches
obviously taken from the outside. Very rarely
do even the best writers of fiction succeed in reproducing
any special and peculiar kind of life and
atmosphere. Of the various stories that purport
to describe what goes on in the English Parliament,
none gives to those who know the social
conditions and habits of the place an impression
of truth to nature, and the same has often been
remarked with regard to tales of English University
life. Trollope, however, with his quick
eye for the superficial aspects of any society,
might have described the House of Commons
admirably had he sat in it himself. He was
fond of travel, and between 1862 and 1880
visited the United States, the West Indies,
Australia and New Zealand, and South Africa,
about all of which he wrote books which, if
hardly of permanent value, were fresh, vigorous,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
and eminently readable, conveying a definite and
generally correct impression of the more obvious
social and economic phenomena he found then
existing. His account of the United States,
for instance, is excellent, and did something to
make the Americans forgive the asperity with
which his mother had described her experiences
there many years before. Trollope&rsquo;s travel
sketches are as much superior in truthfulness to
Froude&rsquo;s descriptions of the same regions as
they are inferior in the allurements of style.</p>
<p>The old classification of novels, based on the
two most necessary elements of a drama, divided
them into novels of plot and novels of character.
To these we have of late years added novels of
incident or adventure, novels of conversation,
novels of manners, not to speak of &ldquo;novels
with a purpose,&rdquo; which are sermons or pamphlets
in disguise. No one doubted to which of these
categories Trollope&rsquo;s work should be referred.
There was in his stories as little plot as a story
can well have. The conversations never beamed
with humour like that of Scott, nor glittered
with aphorisms like those of George Meredith.
The incidents carried the reader pleasantly along,
but seldom surprised him by any ingenuity of
contrivance. Character there was, and, indeed,
great fertility in the creation of character, for
there is hardly one of the tales in which three
or four at least of the personages do not stand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
out as people whom you would know again if
you met them years after. But the conspicuous
merit of Trollope&rsquo;s novels, in the eyes of his
own countrymen, is their value as pictures of
contemporary manners. Here he may claim
to have been surpassed by no writer of his
own generation. Dickens, with all his great
and splendid gifts, did not describe the society
he lived in. His personages were too unusual
and peculiar to speak and act and think
like the ordinary men and women of the nineteenth
century; nor would a foreigner, however
much he might enjoy the exuberant humour and
dramatic power with which they are presented,
learn from them much about the ways and habits
of the average Englishman. The everyday life
to which the stories are most true is the life
of the lower middle class in London; and some
one has observed that although this class changes
less quickly than the classes above it, it is already
unlike that which Dickens saw when in the
&rsquo;thirties he was a police-court reporter. Critics
have, indeed, said that Dickens was too great
a painter to be a good photographer, but the
two arts are not incompatible, as appears from
the skill with which Walter Scott, for instance,
portrayed the peasantry of his own country in
<i>The Antiquary</i>. Thackeray, again, though he
has described certain sections of the upper or
upper middle class with far more power and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
delicacy than Trollope ever reached, does not
go beyond those sections, and has little to tell
us about the middle class generally, still less
about the classes beneath them. Trollope
was thoroughly at home in the English middle
class and also (though less perfectly) in the
upper class; and his pictures are all the more
true to life because there is not that vein of
stern or cynical reflection which runs through
Thackeray, and makes us think less of the
story than of the moral. Trollope usually has
a moral, but it is so obvious, so plainly and
quietly put, that it does not distract attention
from the minor incidents and little touches of
every day which render the sketches lifelike. If
even his best-drawn characters are not far removed
from the commonplace this helps to make them
fairly represent the current habits and notions of
their time. They are the same people we meet
in the street or at a dinner-party; and they are
mostly seen under no more exciting conditions than
those of a hunting meet, or a lawn-tennis match,
or an afternoon tea. They are flirting or talking
for effect, or scheming for some petty temporary
end; they are not under the influence of strong
passions, or forced into striking situations, like
the leading characters in Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s or
George Eliot&rsquo;s novels; and for this reason again
they represent faithfully the ordinary surface of
English upper and upper middle class society:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
its prejudices, its little pharisaisms and hypocrisies,
its snobbishness, its worship of conventionalities,
its aloofness from or condescension to those
whom it deems below its own level; and therewith
also its public spirit, its self-helpfulness,
its neighbourliness, its respect for honesty and
straightforwardness, its easy friendliness of manner
towards all who stand within the sacred pale
of social recognition. Nor, again, has any one
more skilfully noted and set down those transient
tastes and fashions which are, so to speak, the
trimmings of the dress, and which, transient
though they are, and quickly forgotten by contemporaries,
will have an interest for one who,
a century or two hence, feels the same curiosity
about our manners as we feel about those of
the subjects of King George the Third. That
Trollope will be read at all fifty years after
his death one may hesitate to predict, considering
how comparatively few in the present
generation read Richardson, or Fielding, or Miss
Edgeworth, or Charlotte Bront&euml;, and how much
reduced is the number of those who read even
Walter Scott and Thackeray. But whoever
does read Trollope in 1930 will gather from his
pages better than from any others an impression
of what everyday life was like in England in the
&ldquo;middle Victorian&rdquo; period. The aspects of that
life were already, when his latest books were
written, beginning to change, and the features he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
drew are fast receding into history. Even the
clergy of 1852-1862 are no longer, except in
quiet country districts, the same as the clergy
we now see.</p>
<p>People have often compared the personal impressions
which eminent writers make on those
who talk to them with the impressions previously
derived from their works. Thomas Carlyle and
Robert Browning used to be taken as two
instances representing opposite extremes. Carlyle
always talked in character: had there been phonographs
in his days, the phonographed &ldquo;record&rdquo;
might have been printed as part of one of his
books. Browning, on the other hand, seemed
unlike what his poems had made a reader
expect: it was only after a long <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with
him that the poet whose mind had been learned
through his works stood revealed. Trollope at
first caused a similar though less marked surprise.
This bluff burly man did not seem the kind of
person who would trace with a delicate touch
the sunlight sparkling on, or a gust of temper
ruffling, the surface of a youthful soul in love.
Upon further knowledge one perceived that
the features of Trollope&rsquo;s talent, facile invention,
quick observation, and a strong common-sense
view of things, with little originality or
intensity, were really the dominant features of his
character as expressed in talk. Still, though the
man was more of a piece with his books than he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
had seemed, one could never quite recognise in
him the delineator of Lily Dale.</p>
<p>As a painter of manners he recalls two of his
predecessors&mdash;one greater, one less great than
himself. In his limitations and in his fidelity
to the aspects of daily life as he saw them, he
resembles Miss Austen. He is inferior to her
in delicacy of portraiture, in finish, in atmosphere.
No two of his books can be placed on a level
with <i>Emma</i> and <i>Persuasion</i>. On the other hand,
while he has done for the years 1850-1870 what
Miss Burney did for 1770-1790, most critics will
place him above her both in fertility and in
naturalness. Her characters are apt either to
want colour, like the heroines of <i>Evelina</i> and
<i>Cecilia</i>, or to be so exaggerated, like Mr. Briggs
and Miss Larolles, as to approach the grotesque.
Trollope is a realist in the sense of being, in all
but a few of his books, on the lines of normal
humanity, though he is seldom strong enough to
succeed, when he pierces down to the bed-rock of
human nature, in rendering the primal passions
either solemn or terrible. Like Miss Austen, he
attains actuality by observation rather than by
imagination, hardly ever entering the sphere of
poetry.</p>
<p>His range was not wide, for he could not
present either grand characters or tragical situations,
any more than he could break out into
the splendid humour of Dickens. His wings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
never raised him far above the level floor of
earth. But within that limited range he had
surprising fertility. His clerical portrait-gallery
is the most complete that any English novelist
has given us. No two faces are exactly alike,
and yet all are such people as one might see
any day in the pulpit. So, again, there is
scarcely one of his stories in which a young
lady is not engaged, formally or practically, to
two men at the same time, or one man more
or less committed to two women; yet no story
repeats exactly the situation, or raises the
problem of honour and duty in quite the same
form as it appears in the stories that went
before. Few people who have written so much
have so little appeared to be exhausting their
invention.</p>
<p>It must, however, be admitted that Trollope&rsquo;s
fame might have stood higher if he had written
less. The public which had been delighted with
his earlier groups of novels, and especially
with that group in which <i>The Warden</i> comes
first and <i>Barchester Towers</i> second, began
latterly to tire of what they had come to deem
the mannerisms of their favourite, and felt that
they now knew the compass of his gifts.
Partly, perhaps, because he feared to be always
too like himself, he once or twice attempted
to represent more improbable situations and exceptional
personages. But the attempt was not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
successful. He lost his touch of ordinary life
without getting into any higher region of poetical
truth; and in his latest stories he had begun to
return to his earlier and better manner.</p>
<p>New tendencies, moreover, embodying themselves
in new schools, were already beginning to
appear. R. L. Stevenson as leader of the school
of adventure, Mr. Henry James as the apostle of
the school of psychological analysis, soon to be
followed by Mr. Kipling with a type of imaginative
directness distinctively his own, were beginning to
lead minds and tastes into other directions. The
influence of France was more felt than it had
been when Trollope began to write. And what a
contrast between Trollope&rsquo;s manner and that of
his chief French contemporaries, such as Octave
Feuillet or Alphonse Daudet or Guy de Maupassant!
The French novelists, be their faculty of
invention greater or less, at any rate studied their
characters with more care than English writers
had usually shown. The characters were fewer,
almost as few as in a classical drama; and
the whole action of the story is carefully subordinated
to the development of these characters,
and the placing of them in a critical
position which sets their strength and weakness
in the fullest light. There was more of a
judicious adaptation of the parts to the whole
in French fiction than in ours, and therefore more
unity of impression was attained. Trollope, no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
doubt, set a bad example in this respect. He
crowded his canvas with figures; he pursued the
fortunes of three or four sets of people at the same
time, caring little how the fate of the one set
affected that of the others; he made his novel a
sort of chronicle which you might open anywhere
and close anywhere, instead of a drama animated
by one idea and converging towards one centre.
He neglected the art which uses incidents small
in themselves to lead up to the <i>d&eacute;no&ucirc;ment</i> and make
it more striking. He took little pains with his
diction, seeming not to care how he said what he
had to say. These defects strike those who turn
over his pages to-day. But to those who read
him in the &rsquo;fifties or &rsquo;sixties, the carelessness was
redeemed by, or forgotten in, the vivacity with
which the story moved, the freshness and faithfulness
of its pictures of character and manners.</p>

<h2>JOHN RICHARD GREEN<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor2">[22]</a></h2>
</div>
<p>John Richard Green was born in Oxford
on 12th December 1837, and educated first
at Magdalen College School, and afterwards,
for a short time, at a private tutor&rsquo;s. He
was a singularly quick and bright boy, and at
sixteen obtained by competition a scholarship
at Jesus College, Oxford, where he began to
reside in 1856. The members of that college
were in those days almost entirely Welshmen, and
thereby somewhat cut off from the rest of the
University. They saw little of men in other
colleges, so that a man might have a reputation
for ability in his own society without
gaining any in the larger world of Oxford. It
so happened with Green. Though his few
intimate friends perceived his powers, they had
so little intercourse with the rest of the University,
either by way of breakfasts and wine-parties,
or at the University debating society,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
or in athletic sports, that he remained unknown
even to those among his contemporaries who
were interested in the same things, and would
have most enjoyed his acquaintance. The only
eminent person who seems to have appreciated
and influenced him was Dean Stanley, then
Professor of Ecclesiastical History and Canon of
Christ Church. Green had attended Stanley&rsquo;s
lectures, and Stanley, whose kindly interest in
young men never failed, was struck by him, and
had some share in turning his studies towards
history. He graduated in 1860, having refused
to compete for honours, because he had not
received from those who were then tutors of the
college the recognition to which he was entitled.</p>
<p>In 1860 he was ordained, and became curate
in London at St. Barnabas, King&rsquo;s Square,
whence, after two years&rsquo; experience, and one or
two temporary engagements, including the sole
charge of a parish in Hoxton, he was appointed
in 1865 to the incumbency of St. Philip&rsquo;s, Stepney,
a district church in one of the poorest parts of
London, where the vicar&rsquo;s income was ill-proportioned
to the claims which needy parishioners
made upon him. Here he worked with zeal
and assiduity for about three years, gaining an
insight into the condition and needs of the poor
which scholars and historians seldom obtain.
He learnt, in fact, to know men, and the real
forces that sway them; and he used to say in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
later life that he was conscious how much this
had helped him in historical writing. Gibbon,
as every one knows, makes a similar remark
about his experience as a captain in the Hampshire
militia.</p>
<p>Green threw the whole force of his nature
into the parish schools, spending some part of
every day in them; he visited incessantly, and
took an active part in the movement for regulating
and controlling private charity which led
to the formation of the Charity Organisation
Society. An outbreak of cholera and period
of distress among the poor which occurred
during his incumbency drew warm-hearted men
from other parts of London to give their
help to the clergy of the East End. Edward
Denison, who was long affectionately remembered
by many who knew him in Oxford and
London, chose Green&rsquo;s parish to work in, and
the two friends confirmed one another in their
crusade against indiscriminate and demoralising
charity. It was at this time that Green, who
spent upon the parish nearly all that he received
as vicar, found himself obliged to earn some
money by other means, and began to write
for the <i>Saturday Review</i>. The addition of
this labour to the daily fatigues of his parish
duties told on his health, which had always
been delicate, and made him willingly accept
from Archbishop Tait, who had early marked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
and learned to value his abilities, the post of
librarian at Lambeth. He quitted Stepney, and
never took any other clerical work.</p>
<p>Although physical weakness was one of the
causes which compelled this step, there was also
another. He had been brought up in Tractarian
views, and is said to have been at one time on
the point of entering the Church of Rome. This
tendency passed off, and before he went to St.
Philip&rsquo;s he had become a Broad Churchman, and
was much influenced by the writings of Mr. F.
D. Maurice, whom he knew and used frequently
to meet, and whose pure and noble character,
even more perhaps than his preaching, had
profoundly impressed him. However, his restless
mind did not stop long at that point. The same
tendency which had carried him away from
Tractarianism made him feel less and less at
home in the ministry of the Church of England,
and would doubtless have led him, even had his
health been stronger, to withdraw from clerical
duties. After a few years his friends ceased to
address letters to him under the usual clerical
epithet; but he continued to interest himself in
ecclesiastical affairs, and always retained a marked
dislike to Nonconformity. Aversions sometimes
outlive attachments.</p>
<p>On leaving Stepney he went to live in lodgings
in Beaumont Street, Marylebone, and divided
his time between Lambeth and literary work.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
He now during several years wrote a good deal
for the <i>Saturday Review</i>, and his articles were
among the best which then appeared in that
organ. The most valuable of them were reviews
of historical books, and descriptions from
the historical point of view of cities or other remarkable
places, especially English and French
towns. Some of these are masterpieces. Other
articles were on social, or what may be called
occasional, topics, and attracted much notice at
the time from their gaiety and lightness of touch,
which sometimes seemed to pass into flippancy.
He never wrote upon politics, nor was he in the
ordinary sense of the word a journalist, for with
the exception of these social articles, his work
was all done in his own historical field, and done
with as much care and pains as others would
bestow on the composition of a book. Upon
this subject I may quote the words of one of his
oldest and most intimate friends (Mr. Stopford
Brooke), who knew all he did in those days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real history of this writing for the <i>Saturday Review</i>
has much personal, pathetic, and literary interest.</p>
<p>It was when he was vicar of St. Philip&rsquo;s, Stepney, that he
wrote the most. The income of the place was, I think,
&pound;300 a year, and the poverty of the parish was very great.
Mr. Green spent every penny of this income on the parish.
And he wrote&mdash;in order to live, and often when he was
wearied out with the work of the day and late into the night&mdash;two,
and often three, articles a week for the <i>Saturday
Review</i>. It was less of a strain to him than it would have
been to many others, because he wrote with such speed, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
because his capacity for rapidly throwing his subject into
form and his memory were so remarkable. But it was a
severe strain, nevertheless, for one who, at the time, had in
him the beginnings of the disease of which he died.</p>
<p>I was staying with him once for two days, and the first
night he said to me, &ldquo;I have three articles to write for the
<i>Saturday Review</i>, and they must all be done in thirty-six
hours.&rdquo; &ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;and how have you found
time to think of them?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;one is on
a volume of Freeman&rsquo;s <i>Norman Conquest</i>, another is a &lsquo;light
middle,&rsquo; and the last on the history of a small town in
England; and I have worked them all into form as I was
walking to-day about the parish and in London.&rdquo; One of
these studies was finished before two o&rsquo;clock in the morning,
and while I talked to him; the other two were done the next
day. It is not uncommon to reach such speed, but it is very
uncommon to combine this speed with literary excellence of
composition, and with permanent and careful knowledge.
The historical reviews were of use to, and gratefully acknowledged
by, his brother historians, and frequently extended, in
two or three numbers of the <i>Saturday Review</i>, to the length
of an article in a magazine. I used to think them masterpieces
of reviewing, and their one fault was the fault which
was then frequent in that <i>Review</i>&mdash;over-vehemence in
slaughtering its foes. Such reviewing cannot be fairly
described as journalism. It was an historical scholar speaking
to scholars.</p>
<p>Another class of articles written by Mr. Green were articles
on towns in England, France, or Italy. I do not know
whether it was he or Mr. Freeman who introduced this
custom of bringing into a short space the historical aspect of
a single town or of a famous building, and showing how the
town or the building recorded its own history, and how it
was linked to general history, but Mr. Green, at least, began
it very early in his articles on Oxford. At any rate, it was
his habit, at this time, whenever he travelled in England,
France, or Italy, to make a study of any town he visited.</p>
<p>Articles of this kind&mdash;and he had them by fifties in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
head&mdash;formed the second line of what has been called his
journalism. I should prefer to call them contributions to
history. They are totally different in quality from ordinary
journalism. They are short historical essays.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As his duties at Lambeth made no great
demands on his time, he was now able to devote
himself more steadily to historical work. His
first impulse in that direction seems, as I have
said, to have been received from Dean Stanley
at Oxford. His next came from E. A. Freeman,
who had been impressed by an ingenious
paper of his at a meeting of the Somerset
Arch&aelig;ological Society, and who became from that
time his steadfast friend. Green was a born
historian, who would have been eminent without
any help except that of books. But he was wise
enough to know the value of personal counsel
and direction, and generous enough to be heartily
grateful for what he received. He did not belong
in any special sense to what has been called
Freeman&rsquo;s school, differing widely from that distinguished
writer in many of his views, and still
more in style and manner. But he learnt much
from Freeman, and he delighted to acknowledge
his debt. He learnt among other things the value
of accuracy, the way to handle original authorities,
the interpretation of architecture, and he received,
during many years of intimate intercourse, the
constant sympathy and encouragement of a friend
whose affection was never blind to faults, while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
his admiration was never clouded by jealousy.
It was his good fortune to win the regard and
receive the advice of another illustrious historian,
Dr. Stubbs, who has expressed in language
perhaps more measured, but not less emphatic
than Freeman&rsquo;s, his sense of Green&rsquo;s services
to English history. These two he used to call
his masters; but no one who has read him and
them needs to be told that his was one of those
strong and rich intelligences which, in becoming
more perfect by the study of others, loses nothing
of its originality.</p>
<p>His first continuous studies had lain among the
Angevin kings of England, and the note-books still
exist in which he had accumulated materials for
their history. However, the book he planned
was never written, for when the state of his lungs
(which forced him to spend the winter of 1870-71
at San Remo) had begun to alarm his friends,
they urged him to throw himself at once into
some treatise likely to touch the world more than
a minute account of so remote a period could
do. Accordingly he began, and in two or three
years, his winters abroad sadly interrupting work,
he completed the <i>Short History of the English
People</i>. When a good deal of it had gone
through the press, he felt, and his friends agreed
with him, that the style of the earlier chapters
was too much in the eager, quick, sketchy,
&ldquo;point-making&rdquo; manner of his <i>Saturday Review</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
articles, &ldquo;and did not possess&rdquo; (says the friend
whom I have already quoted) &ldquo;enough historical
dignity for a work which was to take in the whole
history of England. It was then, being convinced
of this, that he cancelled a great deal of what
had been stereotyped, and re-wrote it, re-creating,
with his passionate facility, his whole style.&rdquo; In
order to finish it he gave up the <i>Saturday
Review</i> altogether, though he could ill spare what
his writing there brought him in. It is seldom
that one finds such swiftness and ease in composition
as his, united to so much fastidiousness.
He went on remoulding and revising till his
friends insisted that the book should be published
anyhow, and published it accordingly was, in
1874. Feeling that his time on earth might be
short, for he was often disabled even by a catarrh,
he was the readier to yield.</p>
<p>The success of the <i>Short History</i> was rapid
and overwhelming. Everybody bought it. It was
philosophical enough for scholars, and popular
enough for schoolboys. No historical book since
Macaulay&rsquo;s <i>History</i> has made its way so fast, or
been read with so much avidity. And Green was
under disadvantages from which his great predecessor
did not suffer. Macaulay&rsquo;s name was
famous before his <i>History of England</i> appeared,
and Macaulay&rsquo;s scale was so large that he could
enliven his pages with a multitude of anecdotes
and personal details. Green was known only to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
small circle of friends, having written nothing under
his own signature except one or two papers in
magazines or in the Transactions of arch&aelig;ological
societies; and the plan of his book, which dealt, in
eight hundred and twenty pages, with the whole
fourteen centuries of English national life, obliged
him to handle facts in the mass, and touch
lightly and briefly on personal traits. A summary
is of all kinds of writing that which it is hardest
to make interesting, because one must speak
in general terms, one must pack facts tightly
together, one must be content to give those facts
without the delicacies of light and shade, or the
subtler tints of colour. Yet such was his skill,
both literary and historical, that his outlines gave
more pleasure and instruction than other people&rsquo;s
finished pictures.</p>
<p>In 1876 he took, for the only time in his life,
except when he had supported a working-man&rsquo;s
candidate for the Tower Hamlets at the general
election of 1868, an active part in practical
politics. Towards the end of that year, when
war seemed impending between Russia and
the Turks, fears were entertained that England
might undertake the defence of the Sultan, and
a body called the Eastern Question Association
was formed to organise opposition to the pro-Turkish
policy of Lord Beaconsfield&rsquo;s Ministry.
Green threw himself warmly into the movement,
was chosen to serve on the Executive Committee
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
of the Association, and was one of a sub-committee
of five (which included also Mr. Stopford Brooke
and Mr. William Morris the poet<a name='FNanchor_0018' id='FNanchor_0018'></a><a href='#Footnote_0018' class='fnanchor'>[23]</a>) appointed to
draw up the manifesto convoking the meeting of
delegates from all parts of the country, which was
held in December 1876, under the title of the
Eastern Question Conference. The sub-committee
met at my house and spent the whole
day on its work. It was a new and curious
experience to see these three great men of
letters drafting a political appeal. Morris and
Green were both of them passionately anti-Turkish,
and Morris indeed acted for the next
two years as treasurer of the Association, doing
his work with a business-like efficiency such as
poets seldom possess. Green continued to attend
the general committee until, after the Treaty of
Berlin, it ceased to meet, and took the keenest
interest in its proceedings. But his weak health
and frequent winter absences made public appearances
impossible to him. He was all his
life an ardent Liberal. His sympathy with
national movements did not confine itself to
Continental Europe, but embraced Ireland and
made him a Home Ruler long before Mr.
Gladstone and the Liberal party adopted that
policy. It ought to be added that though he
had ceased to belong to the Church of England,
he remained strongly opposed to disestablishment.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></div>
<p>When he had completed the re-casting of his
<i>Short History</i> in the form of a larger book, which
appeared under the title of <i>A History of the
English People</i>, he addressed himself with characteristic
activity to a new project. He had for a
long time meditated upon the <i>origines</i> of English
history, the settlement of the Teutonic invaders
in Britain, followed by the consolidation of their
tribes into a nation with definite institutions and a
settled order; and his desire to treat this topic
was stimulated by the way in which some critics
had sought to disparage his <i>Short History</i>
as a mere popularising of other people&rsquo;s ideas.
The criticism was unjust, for, if there had been
no rummaging in MS. sources for the <i>Short
History</i>, there was abundant originality in the
views the book contained. However, these
carpings disposed his friends to recommend an enterprise
which would lead him to deal chiefly with
original authorities, and to put forth those powers
of criticism and construction which they knew him
to possess. Thus he set to work afresh at the
very beginning, at Roman Britain and the Saxon
Conquest. He had not advanced far when, having
gone to spend the winter in Egypt, he caught an
illness which so told on his weak frame that he was
only just able to return to London in April, and
would not have reached it at all but for the care
with which he was tended by his wife. (He had
married Miss Alice Stopford in 1877.) In a few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
weeks he so far recovered as to be able to resume
his studies, though now forbidden to give to them
more than two or three hours a day. However,
what he could not do alone he did with and through
his wife, who consulted the original sources for
him, investigated obscure points, and wrote at
his dictation. In this way, during the summer
and autumn months of 1881, when often some
slight change of weather would throw him back
and make work impossible for days or weeks,
the book was prepared, which he published in
February 1882, under the title of <i>The Making of
England</i>. Even in those few months it was incessantly
rewritten; no less than ten copies were
made of the first chapter. It was warmly received
by the few persons who were capable of judging
its merits. But he was himself far from satisfied
with it as a literary performance, thinking that a
reader would find it at once too speculative and
too dry, deficient in the details needed to make
the life of primitive England real and instructive.
If this had been so it would have been due to no
failing in his skill, but to the scantiness of the
materials available for the first few centuries of
our national history. But he felt it so strongly
that he was often disposed to recur to his idea of
writing a history of the last seventy or eighty
years, and was only induced by the encouragement
of a few friends to pursue the narrative
which, in <i>The Making of England</i>, he had carried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
down to the reign of Egbert. The winter of 1881
was spent at Mentone, and the following summer
in London. He continued very weak, and was
sometimes unable for weeks together to go out
driving or to work at home. But the moment
that an access of strength returned, the note-books
were brought out, and he was again busy
going through what his wife&rsquo;s industry had
tabulated, and dictating for an hour or two till
fatigue forced him to desist. Those who saw
him during that summer were amazed, not only
at the brave spirit which refused to yield to
physical feebleness, but at the brightness and
clearness of his intellect, which was not only
as active as it had ever been before, but as
much interested in whatever passed in the world.
When one saw him sitting propped up with
cushions on the sofa, his tiny frame worn to
skin and bone, his voice interrupted by frequent
fits of coughing, it seemed wrong to stay, but,
after a little, all was forgotten in the fascination
of his talk, and one found it hard to
realise that where thought was strong speech
might be weak.</p>
<p>In October, when he returned to Mentone,
the tale of early English history had been completed,
and was in type down to the death of
Earl Godwine in <span class='smcaplc'>A.D.</span> 1052. He had hesitated
as to the point at which the book should end,
but finally decided to carry it down to <span class='smcaplc'>A.D.</span> 1085,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
the date of the dispersion of the last great Scandinavian
armament which threatened England. As
the book dealt with both the Danish and Norman
invasions, he called it <i>The Conquest of England</i>.
It appeared after his death, wanting, indeed,
those expansions in several places which he had
meant to give it, but still a book such as few but he
could have produced, full of new light, and equal
in the parts which have been fully handled to the
best work of his earlier years.</p>
<p>Soon after he returned to Mentone he became
rapidly worse, and unfit for any continuous exertion.
He could barely sit in the garden during
an hour or two of morning sunshine. There
I saw him in the end of December, fresh and
keen as ever, aware that the most he could
hope for was to live long enough to complete
his <i>Conquest</i>, but eagerly reading every new
book that came to him from England, starting
schemes for various historical treatises sufficient
to fill three life-times, and ranging in talk over
the whole field of politics, literature, and history.
It seemed as if the intellect and will, which strove
to remain till their work was done, were the only
things which held the weak and wasted body
together. The ardour of his spirit prolonged
life amid the signs of death. In January there
came a new attack, and in February another
unexpected rally. On the 2nd of March he
remarked that it was no use fighting longer,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
and expired five days afterwards at the age of
forty-six.</p>
<p>Short as his life was, maimed and saddened
by an ill-health which gave his powers no fair
chance, it was not an unhappy life, for he had
that immense power of enjoyment which so often
belongs to a vivacious intelligence. He delighted
in books, in travel, in his friends&rsquo; company, in the
constant changes and movements of the world.
No satiety dulled his taste for these things, nor was
his spirit, except for passing moments, darkened
by the shadows which to others seemed to lie
so thick around his path. He enjoyed, though
without boasting, the fame his books had won,
and the sense of creative power. And the last
six years of his life were brightened by the
society and affection of one who entered into
all his tastes and pursuits with the fullest
sympathy, and enabled him, by her unwearied
diligence, to prosecute labours which physical
weakness must otherwise have arrested.</p>
<p>He might have won fame as a preacher or as
a political journalist. It was, however, towards
historical study that the whole current of his
intellect set, and as it is by what he did in that
sphere that he will be remembered, his special
gifts for it deserve to be examined.</p>
<p>A historian needs four kinds of capacity.
First of all, accuracy, and a desire for the exact
truth, which will grudge no time and pains in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
tracing out even what might seem a trivial
matter. Secondly, keen observation, which can
fasten upon small points, and discover in isolated
data the basis for some generalisation, or the
illustration of some principle. Thirdly, a sound
and calm judgment, which will subject all
inferences and generalisations, both one&rsquo;s own
and other people&rsquo;s, to a searching review,
and weigh in delicate scales their validity.
These two last-mentioned qualifications taken
together make up what we call the critical
faculty, <i>i.e.</i> the power of dealing with evidence
as tending to establish or discredit statements
of fact, and those general conclusions which
are built on the grouping of facts. Neither
acuteness alone nor the judicial balance alone is
enough to make the critic. There are men quick
in observation and fertile in suggestion whose
conclusions are worthless, because they cannot
weigh one argument against another, just as
there are solid and well-balanced minds that
never enlighten a subject because, while detecting
the errors of others, they cannot combine the
data and propound a luminous explanation. To
the making of a true critic, in history, in philosophy,
in literature, in psychology, even largely
in the sciences of nature, there should go not only
judgment, but also a certain measure of creative
power. Fourthly, the historian must have imagination,
not indeed with that intensity which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
makes the poet, but in sufficient volume to let him
feel the men of other ages and countries to be
living and real like those among whom he moves,
to present to him a large and full picture of a
world remote from himself in time&mdash;as a world
moving, struggling, hoping, fearing, enjoying, believing,
like the near world of to-day&mdash;a world in
which there went on a private life of thousands or
millions of men and women, vaster, more complex,
more interesting than that public life which is
sometimes all that the records of the past have
transmitted to us. Our imaginative historian
may or may not be able to reconstruct for us the
private and personal as well as the public or
political life of the past. If he can, he will. If
the data are too scanty, he may cautiously forbear.
Yet he will still feel that those whose
movements on the public stage he chronicles
were steeped in an environment of natural
and human influences which must have affected
them at every turn; and he will so describe
them as to make us feel them human, and give
life to the pallid figures of far-off warriors and
lawgivers.</p>
<p>To these four aptitudes one need hardly add
the faculty of literary exposition, for whoever
possesses in large measure the last three, or
even the last alone, cannot fail to interest his
readers; and what more does literary talent
mean?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></div>
<p>Distinguishing these several aptitudes, historians
will be found to fall into two classes,
according as there predominates in them the
critical or the imaginative faculty. Though no
one can attain greatness without both gifts, still
they may be present in very unequal degrees.
Some will investigate tangible facts and their
relations with special care, occupying themselves
chiefly with that constitutional and diplomatic
side of history in which positive conclusions are
(from the comparative abundance of records) most
easily reached. Others will be drawn towards
the dramatic and personal elements in history,
primarily as they appear in the lives of famous
individual men, secondarily as they are seen,
more dimly but not less impressively, in groups
and masses of men, and in a nation at large,
and will also observe and dwell upon incidents
of private life or features of social and
religious custom, which the student of stately
politics passes by.</p>
<p>As Coleridge, when he divided thinkers into
two classes, took Plato as the type of one, Aristotle
of the other, so we may take as representatives of
these two tendencies among historians Thucydides
for the critical and philosophical, Herodotus for the
imaginative and picturesque. The former does not
indeed want a sense of the dramatic grandeur of a
situation; his narrative of the later part of the
Athenian expedition against Syracuse is like a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
piece of &AElig;schylus in prose. So too Herodotus
is by no means without a philosophical view of
things, nor without a critical instinct, although
his generalisations are sometimes vague or
fanciful, and his critical apparatus rudimentary.
Each is so splendid because each is wide, with
the great gifts largely, although not equally,
developed.</p>
<p>Green was an historian of the Herodotean
type. He possessed capacities which belong to
the other type also; he was critical, sceptical,
perhaps too sceptical, and philosophical. Yet
the imaginative quality was the leading and distinctive
quality in his mind and writing. An
ordinary reader, if asked what was the main
impression given by the <i>Short History of the
English People</i>, would answer that it was the
impression of picturesqueness and vividity&mdash;picturesqueness
in attention to the externals of
the life described, vividity in the presentation
of that life itself.</p>
<p>I remember to have once, in talking with
Green about Greek history, told him how I
had heard Mr. Jowett, in discussing the ancient
historians, disparage Herodotus and declare him
unworthy to be placed near Thucydides. Green
answered, almost with indignation, that to say
such a thing showed that eminent scholars might
have little feeling for history. &ldquo;Great as Thucydides
is,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Herodotus is far greater, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
at any rate far more precious. His view was so
much wider.&rdquo; I forget the rest of the conversation,
but what he meant was that Herodotus, to
whom everything in the world was interesting,
and who has told us something about every
country he visited or heard of, had a more fruitful
conception of history than his Athenian successor,
who practically confined himself to politics in the
narrower sense of the term, and that even the
wisdom of the latter is not so valuable to us as the
flood of miscellaneous information which Herodotus
pours out about everything in the early world&mdash;a
world about which we should know comparatively
little if his book had not been preserved.</p>
<p>This deliverance was thoroughly characteristic
of Green&rsquo;s own view of history. Everything was
interesting to him because his imagination laid
hold of everything. When he travelled, nothing
escaped his quick eye, perpetually ranging over
the aspects of places and society. When he went
out to dinner, he noted every person present whom
he had not known before, and could tell you afterwards
something about them. He had a theory,
so to speak, about each of them, and indeed about
every one with whom he exchanged a dozen
words. When he read the newspaper, he seemed
to squeeze all the juice out of it in a few minutes.
Nor was it merely the large events that fixed his
mind; he drew from stray notices of minor current
matters evidence of principles or tendencies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
which escaped other people&rsquo;s eyes. You never
left him without having new light thrown upon
the questions of the hour. His memory was retentive,
but more remarkable was the sustained
keenness of apprehension with which he read,
and which made him fasten upon everything in
a book or in talk which was significant, and
could be made the basis for an illustration of
some view. He had the Herodotean quality of
reckoning nothing, however small or apparently
remote from the main studies of his life, to
be trivial or unfruitful. His imagination vitalised
the small things, and found a place for them
in the pictures he was always sketching out.</p>
<p>As this faculty of discerning hidden meanings
and relations was one index and consequence
of his imaginative power, so another was found
in that artistic gift to which I have referred. To
give literary form to everything was a necessity
of his intellect. He could not tell an anecdote
or repeat a conversation without unconsciously
dramatising it, putting into people&rsquo;s mouths better
phrases than they would have themselves employed,
and giving a finer point to the moral
which the incident expressed. Verbal accuracy
suffered, but what he thought the inner truth
came out the more fully.</p>
<p>Though he wrote very fast, and in the most
familiar way, the style of his more serious letters
was as good, I might say as finished, as that of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
books. Every one of them had a beginning,
middle, and end. The ideas were developed in an
apt and graceful order, the sentences could all be
construed, the diction was choice. It was the
same with the short articles which he at one time
used to write for the <i>Saturday Review</i>. They
are little essays, some of them worthy to live not
only for the excellent matter they contain, but
for the delicate refinement of their form. Yet
they were all written swiftly, and sometimes in
the midst of physical exhaustion. The friend I
have previously quoted describes the genesis of
one. Green had reached the town of Troyes
early one morning with two companions, and
immediately started off to explore it, darting
hither and thither through the streets like a dog
trying to find a scent. In two or three hours the
examination was complete. The friends lunched
together, took the train on to Basel, got there
late, and went off to bed. Green, however, wrote
before he slept, and laid on the breakfast-table
next morning, an article on Troyes, in which its
characteristic features were brought out and connected
with its fortunes and those of the Counts
of Champagne during some centuries, an article
which was really a history in miniature. Then they
went out together to look at Basel, and being asked
some question about that city he gave on the spur
of the moment a sketch of its growth and character
equally vivid and equally systematic, grouping all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
he had to say round two or three leading theories.
Yet he had never been in either place before, and
had not made a special study of either. He could
apparently have done the same for many another
town in France or the Rhineland.</p>
<p>Nothing struck one so much in daily intercourse
with him as his passionate interest in
human life. The same quickness of sympathy
which had served him well in his work among
the East End poor, enabled him to pour feeling
into the figures of a bygone age, and become
the most human, and in so far the most real and
touching, of all who have dealt with English
history. Whether or not his portraits are true,
they always seem to breathe.</p>
<p>Men and women&mdash;that is to say, such of them
as have characteristics pronounced enough to
make them classifiable&mdash;may be divided into
those whose primary interests are in nature and
what relates to nature, and those whose primary
interests are in and for man. Green was the most
striking type I have known of the latter class,
not merely because his human interests were
strong, but also because they excluded, to a
degree singular in a mind so versatile, interests
in purely natural things. He did not seem to
care for or seek to know any of the sciences of
nature<a name='FNanchor_0019' id='FNanchor_0019'></a><a href='#Footnote_0019' class='fnanchor'>[24]</a> except in so far as they bore directly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
upon man&rsquo;s life, and were capable of explaining
it or of serving it. He had a keen eye for
country, for the direction and character of hills,
the position and influence of rivers, forests, and
marshes, of changes in the line of land and sea.
Readers of <i>The Making of England</i> will recall
the picture of the physical aspects of Britain when
the Teutonic invaders entered it as an unsurpassed
piece of reconstructive description. So
on a battle-field or in an historical town, his
vision of the features of the ground or the site
was unerring. But he perceived and enjoyed
natural beauty chiefly in reference to human life.
The study of the battle-field and the town site
were aids to the comprehension of historical
events. The exquisite landscape was exquisite
because it was associated with the people dwelling
there, with the processes of their political growth,
with their ideas or their social usages. I remember
to have had from him the most vivid
descriptions of the towns of the Riviera and
of Capri, where he used to pass the winter, but
he never touched on anything which did not
illustrate or intertwine itself with the life of the
people, leaving one uninformed on matters purely
physical. Facts about the character of the
mountains, the relation of their ranges to one
another, or their rocks, or the trees and flowers
of their upper regions, the prospects their
summits command, the scenes of beauty in their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
glens, or beside their wood-embosomed lakes,
all, in fact, which the mountain lover delights
in, and which are to him a part of the mountain
ardour, of the passion for pure nature unsullied
by the presence of man&mdash;all this was cold to
him. But as soon as a touch of human life fell
like a sunbeam across the landscape, all became
warm and lovable.</p>
<p>It was the same with art. With an historian&rsquo;s
delight in the creative ages and their work, he
had a fondness for painting and sculpture, and
could so describe what he saw in the galleries and
churches of Italy as to bring out meanings one
had not perceived before. But here, too, it was
the human element that fascinated him. Technical
merits, though he observed them, as he observed
most things, were forgotten; he dwelt only on
what the picture expressed or revealed. Pure
landscape painting gave him little pleasure.</p>
<p>It seems a truism to say that one who writes
history ought to care for all that bears upon
man in the present in order that he may comprehend
what bore upon him in the past. This
roaring loom of Time, these complex physical
and moral forces playing round us, and driving
us hither and thither by such a strange and
intricate interlacement of movements that we
seem to perceive no more than what is next us,
and are unable to say whither we are tending,
ought to be always before the historian&rsquo;s mind.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
But there are few who have tried, as Green
tried, to follow every flash of the shuttle, and to
discover a direction and a relation amidst apparent
confusion, for there are few who have taken
so wide a view of the historian&rsquo;s functions, and
have so distinctly set before them as their object
the comprehension and realisation and description
of the whole field of bygone human life.
The Past was all present to him in this sense,
that he saw and felt in it not only those large
events which annalists or state papers have recorded,
but the everyday life of the people, their
ideas, their habits, their external surroundings.
And the Present was always as if past to him
in this sense, that in spite of his strong political
feelings, he looked at it with the eye of a
philosophical observer, trying to disengage principles
from details, permanent tendencies from
passing outbursts. His imagination visualised,
so to speak, the phenomena as in a picture; his
speculative faculty tried to harmonise them,
measure them, and forecast their effects. Hence
it was a necessity to him to know what was
passing in the world. The first thing he did
every day, whatever other pressure there might
be on him, was to read the daily newspaper.
The last thing that he ceased to read, when what
remained of life began to be counted by hours,
was the daily newspaper. This warm interest in
mankind is the keynote of his <i>History of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
English People</i>. It is the whole people that is
ever present to him, as it had been present before
to few other historians.</p>
<p>Such power of imagination and sympathy as I
have endeavoured to describe is enough to make
a brilliant writer, yet not necessarily a great
historian. One must see how far the other
qualifications, accuracy, acuteness of observation,
and judgment, are also brought into action.</p>
<p>His accuracy has been much impeached. When
the first burst of applause that welcomed the
<i>Short History</i> had subsided, several critics began
to attack it on the score of minor errors. They
pointed out a number of statements of fact which
were doubtful, and others which were incorrect,
and spread in some quarters the impression that
Green was a careless and untrustworthy writer.
I do not deny that there are in the first editions
of the <i>Short History</i> some assertions made
more positively than the evidence warrants,
some pictures drawn from exceedingly slender
materials. Mr. Skene remarks of the account
given of the battle between the Jutes and the
Britons which took place in the middle of the fifth
century, somewhere near Aylesford in Kent, and
about which we really know scarcely anything,
&ldquo;Mr. Green describes it as if he had been present.&rdquo;
The temptation to such liberties is strong where
the treatment of a period is summary. A writer
who compresses the whole history of England
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
into eight hundred pages of small octavo, making
his narrative not a bare narrative but a picture
full of colour and incident&mdash;incident which, for
brevity&rsquo;s sake, must often be given by allusion&mdash;cannot
be always interrupting the current of the
story to indicate doubts or quote authorities for
every statement in which there may be an
element of conjecture; and it is probable that
when the authorities are scrutinised their result
will sometimes appear different from that which
the author has presented. On this head the
<i>Short History</i> may be admitted to have occasionally
purchased vividity at the price of exactitude.
Of mistakes, strictly so called&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> statements
demonstrably incorrect and therefore ascribable
to haste or carelessness&mdash;there are enough to
make a show under the hands of a hostile critic,
yet not more than one is prepared to expect
from any but the most careful scholars. The
book falls far short of the accuracy of Thirlwall
or Ranke or Stubbs, short even of the accuracy
of Gibbon or Carlyle; but it is not greatly
below the standard of Grote or Macaulay or
Robertson, it is equal to the standard of Milman,
above that of David Hume. I take famous
names, and could put a better face on the matter
by choosing for comparison divers contemporary
writers whose literary eminence is higher than
their historical. And Green&rsquo;s mistakes, although
pretty numerous, were (for they have been corrected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
in later editions) nearly all in small matters.
He puts an event, let us say, in 1340 which
happened in the November of 1339; he calls a
man John whose name was William. These are
mistakes to the eye of a civil service examiner,
but they seldom make any difference to the
general reader, for they do not affect the doctrines
and pictures which the book contains, and in
which lies its permanent value as well as its literary
charm. As Bishop Stubbs says, &ldquo;Like other
people, Green makes mistakes sometimes; but
scarcely ever does the correction of his mistakes
affect either the essence of the picture or the
force of the argument.... All his work was
real and original work; few people besides those
who knew him well would see under the charming
ease and vivacity of his style the deep research
and sustained industry of the laborious student.&rdquo;
It may be added that Green&rsquo;s later and more
detailed works, <i>The Making of England</i> and
<i>The Conquest of England</i>, though they contain
plenty of debatable matter, as in the paucity
of authentic data any such book must do, have
been charged with few errors in matters of
fact.</p>
<p>In considering his critical gift, it is well to distinguish
those two elements of acute perception
and sober judgment which I have already specified,
for he possessed the former in larger measure than
the latter. The same activity of mind which made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
him notice everything while travelling or entering
a company of strangers, played incessantly
upon the historical data of his work, and supplied
him with endless theories as to the meaning of
a statement, the source it came from, the way it
had been transmitted, the conditions under which
it was made. No one could be more acute and
penetrating in what the Germans call <i>Quellenforschung</i>,
the collection and investigation and
testing of the sources of history, nor could any
one be more painstaking. Errors of view, apart
from those trivial inaccuracies already referred to,
did not arise from an indolence that left any
stone unturned, but rather from an occupation
with the leading idea which had drawn his
attention away from the details of time and place.
The ingenuity with which he built up theories
was as admirable as the art with which he
stated them. People whom that art fascinated
sometimes fancied that the charm lay entirely in
the style. But the style was only a part of the
craftsmanship. The facility in theorising, the
power of grouping facts under new aspects, the
skill in gathering and sifting evidence, were
as remarkable as those artistic qualities which
expressed themselves in the paragraphs and
sentences and phrases. What danger there was
arose from this fecundity. His mind was so
fertile, could see so much in a theory and apply
it so dexterously, that his judgment was sometimes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
dazzled by the brilliance of his ingenuity.
I do not think he loved his theories specially
because they were his own, for he often modified
them, and was ready to consider any one else&rsquo;s
suggestions; but he had a passion for light, and
when a new view seemed to him to explain things
previously dark, he wanted the patience to suspend
his judgment and abide in uncertainty.
Some of his hypotheses he himself dropped.
Some others he probably would have dropped,
as the authorities he respected have not embraced
them. Others have made their way into general
acceptance, and may become still more useful as
future research works them out. But, whether
right or wrong, they were instructive. Every
one of them is based upon facts whose importance
had not been so fully seen before, and
suggests a point of view worth considering.
Green&rsquo;s view may sometimes appear fanciful: it
is never foolish, or superficial, or perverse. And
so far from being credulous, his natural tendency
was towards doubt.</p>
<p>Inventive as his mind was, it was also solvent
and sceptical. Seldom is a strong imagination
coupled with so unsparing a criticism as that
which he applied to the materials on which the
constructive faculty had to work. His later
tendencies were rather towards scepticism, and
towards what one may call a severe and ascetic
view of history. While writing <i>The Making of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
England</i> and <i>The Conquest of England</i>, he used
to lament the scantiness of the data and the
barren dryness which he feared the books would
consequently show. &ldquo;How am I to make anything
of these meagre entries of marches and
battles which are the only materials for the history
of whole centuries? Here are the Norsemen
and Danes ravaging and occupying the country;
we learn hardly anything about them from English
sources, and nothing at all from Danish. How
can one conceive and describe them? how have
any comprehension of what England was like in
the districts the Northmen took and ruled?&rdquo; I
tried to get him to work at the Norse Sagas, and
remember in particular to have entreated him
when he came to the battle of Brunanburh to
eke out the pitifully scanty records of that fight
from the account given of it in the story of
the Icelandic hero, Egil, son of Skallagrim.
But he answered that the Saga was unhistorical,
a bit of legend written down more than a
century after the events, and that he could not,
by using it in the text, appear to trust it, or to
mix up authentic history with what was possibly
fable. It was urged that he could guard himself
in a note from being supposed to take it
for more than what it was, a most picturesque
embellishment of his tale. But he stood firm.
Throughout these two last books, he steadily
refrained from introducing any matter, however
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
lively or romantic, which could not stand the
test of his stringent criticism, and used laughingly
to tell how Dean Stanley had long ago said to
him, after reading one of his earliest pieces, &ldquo;I
see you are in danger of growing picturesque.
Beware of it. I have suffered for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If in these later years he reined in his
imagination more tightly, the change was due
to no failing in his ingenuity. Nothing in
his work shows higher constructive ability than
<i>The Making of England</i>. He had to deal
with a time which has left us scarcely any
authentic records, and to piece together his narrative
and his picture of the country out of these
records, and the indications, faint and scattered,
and often capable of several interpretations, which
are supplied by the remains of Roman roads and
villas, the names of places, the boundaries of local
divisions, the casual statements of writers many
centuries later. What he has given us remains
an enduring witness to his historical power.
For here it is not a question of mere brilliance
of style. The result is due to patience, penetration,
and the careful weighing of evidence,
joined to that faculty of realising things in
the concrete by which a picture is conjured up
out of a mass of phenomena, everything falling
into its place under laws which seem to prove
themselves as soon as they are stated.</p>
<p>Of his style nothing need be said, for his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
readers have felt its charm. But it deserves
to be remarked that this accomplished master
of words had little verbal memory. He used
to say that he could never recollect a phrase in
its exact form, and in his books he often unconsciously
varied, writing from memory, some expression
whose precise form is on record. Nor
had he any turn for languages. German he knew
scarcely at all, a fact which makes the range of his
historical knowledge appear more striking; and
though he had spent several winters in Italy, he
could not speak Italian except so far as he
needed it for the inn or the railway. The want
of mere verbal memory partly accounts for this
deficiency, but it was not unconnected with the
vehemence of his interest in the substance of
things. He was so anxious to get at the kernel
that he could not stop to examine the nut. In
this absence of linguistic gifts, as well as in the
keenness of his observation (and in his shortsightedness),
he resembled Dean Stanley, who,
though he had travelled in and brought back all
that was best worth knowing from every country
in Europe, had no facility in any language but his
own.</p>
<p>Green was not one of those whose personality
is unlike their books, for there was in both the
same fertility, the same vivacity, the same quickness
of sympathy. Nevertheless, his conversation
seemed to give an even higher impression
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
of intellectual power than did his writings,
because it was so swift and so spontaneous.
Such talk has rarely been heard in our time, so
gay was it, so vivid, so various, so full of anecdote
and illustration, so acute in criticism, so
candid in consideration, so graphic in description,
so abundant in sympathy, so flashing in
insight, so full of colour and emotion as well as
of knowledge and thought. One had to forbid
one&rsquo;s self to visit him in the evening, because
it was impossible to get away before two o&rsquo;clock
in the morning. And, unlike many famous
talkers, he was just as willing to listen as to
speak. One of the charms of his company
was that it made a man feel better than his
ordinary self. His appreciation of whatever had
any worth in it, his comments and replies,
so stimulated the interlocutor&rsquo;s mind that it
moved faster and could hit upon apter expressions
than at any other time. The same
gifts which shone in his conversation, lucid
arrangement of ideas, ready command of words,
and a power in perceiving the tendencies of
those whom he addressed, would have made
him an admirable public speaker. I do not
remember that he ever did speak, in his later
years, to any audience larger than a committee
of twenty. But he was an eloquent preacher.
The first time I ever saw him was in St. Philip&rsquo;s
Church at Stepney about 1866, and I shall never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
forget the impression made on me by the impassioned
sentences that rang through the church
from the fiery little figure in the pulpit with its
thin face and bright black eyes.</p>
<p>What Green accomplished seems to those who
used to listen to him little in comparison with
what he might have done had longer life and a
more robust body been granted him. Some of
his finest gifts would not have found their full
scope till he came to treat of a period where the
materials for history are ample, and where he
could have allowed himself space to deal with
them&mdash;such a period, for instance, as that of his
early choice, the Angevin kings of England.
Yet, even basing themselves on what he has
done, they may claim for him a place among the
foremost writers of his time. He left behind him
no one who combined so many of the best gifts.
There were among his contemporaries historians
more learned and equally industrious. There were
two or three whose accuracy was more scrupulous,
their judgment more uniformly sober and cautious.
But there was no one in whom so much knowledge
and so wide a range of interests were united
to such ingenuity, acuteness, and originality, as
well as to such a power of presenting results in
rich, clear, pictorial language. A master of style
may be a worthless historian. We have instances.
A skilful investigator and sound reasoner may be
unreadable. The conjunction of fine gifts for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
investigation with fine gifts for exposition is a
rare conjunction, which cannot be prized too
highly, for while it advances historical science, it
brings historical methods, as well as historical
facts, within the horizon of the ordinary reader.</p>
<p>Of the services Green rendered to English
history, the first, and that which was most
promptly appreciated, was the intensity with
which he realised, and the skill with which he
portrayed, the life of the people of England as
a whole, and taught his readers that the exploits
of kings and the intrigues of ministers, and the
struggles of parties in Parliament, are, after all,
secondary matters, and important chiefly as they
affect the welfare or stimulate the thoughts and
feelings of the great mass of undistinguished
humanity in whose hands the future of a nation
lies. He changed the old-fashioned distribution
of our annals according to reigns and dynasties
into certain periods, showing that such divisions
often obscure the true connection of events, and
suggesting new and better conceptions of the
periods into which the record of English progress
naturally falls. And, lastly, he laid, in his latest
books, a firm and enduring foundation for our
medi&aelig;val history by that account of the Teutonic
occupation of England, of the state of the country
as they found it, and the way they conquered and
began to organise it, which I have already dwelt
on as a signal proof of his constructive faculty.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></div>
<p>Many readers will be disposed to place him
near Macaulay, for though he was less weighty
he was more subtle, and not less fascinating. To
fewer perhaps will it occur to compare him with
Gibbon, yet I am emboldened by the opinion of
one of our greatest contemporary historians to
venture on the comparison. There are indeed
wide differences between the two. Green is
as completely a man of the nineteenth century
as Gibbon was a man of the eighteenth. Green&rsquo;s
style has not the majestic march of Gibbon: it
is quick and eager almost to restlessness. Nor
is his judgment so uniformly grave and sound.
But one may find in his genius what was
characteristic of Gibbon&rsquo;s also, the combination
of a mastery of multitudinous details, with a large
and luminous view of those far-reaching forces
and relations which govern the fortunes of peoples
and guide the course of empire. This width and
comprehensiveness, this power of massing for the
purposes of argument the facts which his literary
art has just been clothing in its most brilliant
hues, is the highest of a historian&rsquo;s gifts, and is
the one which seems most surely to establish
Green&rsquo;s position among the leading historical
minds of his time.</p>

<a name='SIR_GEORGE_JESSEL_MASTER_OF_THE_ROLLS' id='SIR_GEORGE_JESSEL_MASTER_OF_THE_ROLLS'></a>
<h2>SIR GEORGE JESSEL, MASTER OF THE ROLLS</h2>
</div>
<p>There is hardly any walk of English life in
which brilliant abilities win so little fame for
their possessor among the public at large as
that of practice at the Chancery bar. A
leading ecclesiastic, or physician, or surgeon,
or financier, or manufacturer, or even a great
man of science, unless his work is done in some
sphere which, like pure mathematics, is far
removed from the comprehension of ordinary
educated men, is sure, in a time like ours, to
become well known to the world and acquire
influence in it. A great advocate practising in
the Common-law Courts is, of course, still more
certain to become a familiar figure. But the cases
which are dealt with by the Courts of Equity,
though they often involve vast sums of money
and raise intricate and important points of
law, mostly turn on questions of a technical
kind, and are seldom what the newspapers call
sensational. Thus it may happen that a practitioner
or a judge in these Courts enjoys an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
extraordinary reputation within his profession,
and is by them regarded as one of the ornaments
of his time, while the rest of his fellow-countrymen
know nothing at all about his merits.</p>
<p>This was the case with Sir George Jessel,
though towards the end of his career the admiration
which the Bar felt for his powers began so
far to filter through to the general public that
his premature death was felt to be a national
misfortune.</p>
<p>Jessel (born in 1824, died in 1883) was only
one among many instances England has lately
seen of men of Jewish origin climbing to the
highest distinction. But he was the first instance
of a Jew who, continuing to adhere to the creed of
his forefathers, received a very high office; for Mr.
Disraeli, as every one knows, had been baptized
as a boy, and always professed to be a Christian.
Jessel&rsquo;s career was not marked by any remarkable
incidents. He rose quickly to eminence at the bar,
being in this aided by his birth; for the Jews in
London, as elsewhere, hold together. There are
among them many solicitors in large practice, and
these take a natural pleasure in pushing forward
any specially able member of their community.
His powers were more fully seen and appreciated
when he became (in 1865) a Queen&rsquo;s Counsel,
and brought him with unusual speed to the front
rank. He came into Parliament at the general
election of 1868 on the Liberal side, and three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
years later was made Solicitor-General in Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s first Government, retaining, as was
then usual, his private practice, which had become
so large that there was scarcely any case of
first-rate importance brought into the Chancery
Courts in which he did not appear. Although
a decided Liberal, as the Jews mostly were
until Lord Beaconsfield&rsquo;s foreign policy had
begun to lead them into other paths, he had
borne little part in politics till he took his
seat in the House of Commons; and when
he spoke there, he obtained no great success.
Lawyers in the English Parliament are under
the double disadvantage of having had less leisure
than most other members to study and follow
political questions, and of having contracted a
manner and style of speaking not suited to an
assembly which, though deliberative, is not deliberate,
and which listens with impatience to a
technical or forensic method of treating the topics
which come before it.</p>
<p>Jessel&rsquo;s ability would have soon overcome
the former difficulty, but less easily the latter.
Though he was lucid and powerful in his treatment
of legal topics, and made a quite admirable
law officer in the way of advising ministers and
the public departments, he was never popular
with the House of Commons, for he presented
his views in a hard, dry, dogmatic form, with no
graces of style or delivery. However, he did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
not long remain in that arena, but on the retirement
of Lord Romilly from the office of Master
of the Rolls, was in 1873 appointed to succeed him.
In this post his extraordinary gifts found their
amplest sphere. The equity judges in England
used always to sit, and in nearly all cases do still
sit, without a jury to hear causes, with or without
witnesses, and they despatch a great deal of the
heaviest business that is brought into the courts.
Commercial causes of the first importance come
before them, no less than those which relate to
trusts or to real property; and the granting of
injunctions, a specially serious matter, rests chiefly
in their hands. Each equity judge sits alone, and
the suitor may choose before which of them he will
bring his case. Among the four&mdash;a number subsequently
increased to five&mdash;equity judges of first
instance, Jessel immediately rose to the highest
reputation, so that most of the heavy and difficult
cases were brought into his court. He possessed
a wonderfully quick, as well as powerful, mind,
which got to the kernel of a matter while other
people were still hammering at the shell, and
which applied legal principles just as swiftly and
surely as it mastered a group of complicated facts.</p>
<p>The Rolls Court used to present, while he
presided over it, a curious and interesting sight,
which led young counsel, who had no business
to do there, to frequent it for the mere sake of
watching the Judge. When the leading counsel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
for the plaintiff was opening his case, Jessel
listened quietly for the first few minutes only,
and then began to address questions to the
counsel, at first so as to guide his remarks in a
particular direction, then so as to stop his course
altogether and turn his speech into a series of
answers to the Judge&rsquo;s interrogatories. When,
by a short dialogue of this kind, Jessel had
possessed himself of the vital facts, he would
turn to the leading counsel for the defendant
and ask him whether he admitted such and such
facts alleged by the plaintiff to be true. If these
facts were admitted, the Judge proceeded to
indicate the view he was disposed to take of the
law applicable to the facts, and, by a few more
questions to the counsel on the one side or the
other, as the case might be, elicited their respective
legal grounds of contention. If the facts
were not admitted, it of course became necessary
to call the witnesses or read the affidavits,
processes which the vigorous impatience of
the Judge considerably shortened, for it was a
dangerous thing to read to him any irrelevant
or loosely-drawn paragraph. But more generally
his searching questions and the sort of pressure
he applied so cut down the issues of fact that
there was little or nothing left in controversy
regarding which it was necessary to examine the
evidence in detail, since the counsel felt that
there was no use in putting before him a contention
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
which they could not sustain under the fire
of his criticism. Then Jessel proceeded to deliver
his opinion and dispose of the case. The affair
was from beginning to end far less an argument
and counter-argument by counsel than an investigation
directly conducted by the Judge himself,
in which the principal function of the counsel
was to answer the Judge&rsquo;s questions concisely
and exactly, so that the latter might as soon as
possible get to the bottom of the matter. The
Bar in a little while came to learn and adapt
themselves to his ways, and few complained of
being stopped or interrupted by him, because
his interruptions, unlike those of some judges,
were neither inopportune nor superfluous. The
counsel (with scarcely an exception) felt themselves
his inferiors, and recognised not only that
he was better able to handle the case than they
were, but that the manner and style in which they
presented their facts or arguments would make
little difference to the result, because his penetration
was sure to discover the merits of each contention,
and neither eloquence nor pertinacity
would have the slightest effect on his resolute
and self-confident mind. Thus business was
despatched before him with unexampled speed,
and it became a maxim among barristers that,
however low down in the cause-list at the
Rolls your cause might stand, it was never
safe to be away from the court, so rapidly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
were cases &ldquo;crumpled up&rdquo; or &ldquo;broken down&rdquo;
under the blows of this vigorous intellect.
It was more surprising that the suitors, as well
as the Bar and the public generally, acquiesced,
after the first few months, in this way of
doing business. Nothing breeds more discontent
than haste and heedlessness in a judge.
But Jessel&rsquo;s speed was not haste. He did as
much justice in a day as others could do in a
week; and those few who, dissatisfied with these
rapid methods, tried to reverse his decisions before
the Court of Appeal, were very seldom successful,
although that court then contained in Lord Justice
James and Lord Justice Mellish two unusually
strong men, who would not have hesitated to
differ even from the redoubtable Master of the
Rolls.</p>
<p>As I have mentioned Lord Justice Mellish, I
may turn aside for a moment to say a word regarding
that extraordinary man, who stood along
with Cairns and Roundell Palmer in the foremost
rank of Jessel&rsquo;s professional contemporaries.
Mellish held for some years before his elevation
to the Bench in 1869 a position unique at the
English Common-law Bar as a giver of opinions
on points of law. As the Israelites in King
David&rsquo;s day said of Ahithophel that his counsel
was as if a man had inquired at the oracle of
God,<a name='FNanchor_0020' id='FNanchor_0020'></a><a href='#Footnote_0020' class='fnanchor'>[25]</a> so the legal profession deemed Mellish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
practically infallible, and held an opinion signed
by him to be equal in weight to a judgment of
the Court of Exchequer Chamber (the then court
of appeal in common-law cases). He was not
effective as an advocate addressing a jury, being
indeed far too good for any jury; but in arguing
a point of law his unerring logic, the lucidity
with which he stated his position, the cogency
and precision with which he drew his inferences,
made it a delight to listen to him. The chain of
ratiocination seemed irrefragable:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><span class='greek' title="en d' ethet' akmothet&ocirc; megan akmona, kopte de desmous">&#x1F10;&nu; &delta;&#x1FBD; &#x1F14;&theta;&epsilon;&tau;&#x1FBD; &#x1F00;&kappa;&mu;&omicron;&theta;&#x3AD;&tau;&#x1FF3; &mu;&#x3AD;&gamma;&alpha;&nu; &#x1F04;&kappa;&mu;&omicron;&nu;&alpha;, &kappa;&#x3CC;&pi;&tau;&epsilon; &delta;&#x1F72; &delta;&epsilon;&sigma;&mu;&omicron;&#x1F7A;&sigmaf;</span><br />

</td></tr></table>
<p>He had, indeed, but one fault as an arguer.
He could not argue a point whose soundness he
doubted as effectively as one in which he had
faith; and when it befell that several points arose
in a case, and the Court seemed disposed to lay
more stress on the one for which he cared little
than on the one he deemed conclusive, he refused
to fall in with their view and continued to insist
upon that which his own mind approved.</p>
<p>I remember to have once heard him and
Cairns argue before the House of Lords (sitting
as the final Court of Appeal) a case relating
to a vessel called the <i>Alexandra</i>&mdash;it was a case
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
arising out of an attempt of the Confederates,
during the American War of Secession, to get
out of a British port a cruiser they had ordered.
Cairns spoke first with all his usual power, and
seemed to have left nothing to be added. But
when Mellish followed on the same side, he set
his points in so strong a light, and placed his
contention on so solid a basis, that even Cairns&rsquo;s
speech was forgotten, and it seemed impossible
that any answer could be found to Mellish&rsquo;s
arguments. One felt as if the voice of pure
reason were speaking through his lips.</p>
<p>Such an intellect might seem admirably qualified
for judicial work. But as a judge, Mellish,
admirable though he was in temper, in fairness,
in learning, and in logic, did not win so exceptional
a reputation as he had won at the Bar. People used
to ascribe this partly to his weak health, partly
to the fact that he, who had been a common-law
practitioner, was sitting in a court which heard
equity appeals, and alongside of a quick and
strong colleague reared in the equity courts.<a name='FNanchor_0022' id='FNanchor_0022'></a><a href='#Footnote_0022' class='fnanchor'>[27]</a>
But something may have been due to the fact
that he needed the stimulus of conflict to bring
out the full force of his splendid intelligence.
A circumstance attending the appointment of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
Mellish illustrates the remark already made
that a great counsel whose work lies apart
from so-called &ldquo;sensation cases&rdquo; may remain
unknown to his contemporaries. When Mr.
Gladstone, being then Prime Minister, and
having to select a Lord Justice of Appeal,
was told that Mellish was the fittest man for
the post, he asked, &ldquo;Can that be the boy
who was my fag at Eton?&rdquo; He had not
heard of Mellish during the intervening forty
years!</p>
<p>However, I return to the Master of the Rolls.
In dealing with facts, Jessel has never had a
superior, and in our days, perhaps, no rival. He
knew all the ways of the financial and commercial
world. In his treatment of points of law, every
one admitted and admired both an extraordinary
knowledge and mastery of reported cases, and
an extremely acute and exact appreciation of
principles, a complete power of extracting them
from past cases and fitting them to the case in
hand. He had a memory which forgot nothing, and
which, indeed, wearied him by refusing to forget
trivial things. When he delivered an elaborate
judgment it was his delight to run through a long
series of cases, classifying and distinguishing
them. His strength made him bold; he went
further than most judges in readiness to carry
a principle somewhat beyond any decided case,
and to overrule an authority which he did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
respect. The fault charged on him was his
tendency, perhaps characteristic of the Hebrew
mind, to take a somewhat hard and dry view
of a legal principle, overlooking its more delicate
shades, and, in the interpretation of
statutes or documents, to adhere too strictly to
the letter, overlooking the spirit. An eminent
lawyer said, &ldquo;If all judges had been like
Jessel, there might have been no equity.&rdquo; In
that respect many deemed him inferior to
Lord Cairns, the greatest judge among his contemporaries,
who united to an almost equally
wide and accurate knowledge of the law a grasp
of principles even more broad and philosophical
than Jessel&rsquo;s was. Be this as it may, the
judgments of the Master of the Rolls, which
fill so many pages of the recent English Law
Reports, are among the best that have ever gone
to build up the fabric of the English law. Except
on two occasions, when he reserved judgment
at the request of his colleagues in the Court
of Appeal, they were delivered on the spur of
the moment, after the conclusion of the arguments,
or of so much of the arguments as he
allowed counsel to deliver; but they have all the
merits of carefully-considered utterances, so clear
and direct is their style, so concisely as well as
cogently are the authorities discussed and the
grounds of decision stated. The bold and sweeping
character which often belongs to them makes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
them more instructive as well as more agreeable
reading than the judgments of most modern
judges, whose commonest fault is a timidity
which tries to escape, by dwelling on the details
of the particular case, from the enunciation
of a definite general principle. Positive and
definite Jessel always was. As he put it himself:
&ldquo;I may be wrong, but I never have any
doubts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the Bar, Jessel had been far from popular;
for his manners were unpolished, and his conduct
towards other counsel overbearing. On the
Bench he improved, and became liked as well as
respected. There was a sort of rough <i>bonhomie</i>
about him, and though he could be disagreeable
on occasions to a leading counsel, especially if
brought from the common-law bar into his court,
he showed a good-humoured wish to deal gently
with young or inexperienced barristers. There
was also an obvious anxiety to do justice, an
impatience of mere technicalities, and a readiness,
remarkable in so strong-willed a man, to hear
what could be said against his own opinion, and to
reconsider it. Besides, a profession is naturally
proud of any one whose talents adorn it, and
whose eminence seems to be communicated to
the whole body.</p>
<p>Ever since, under the Plantagenet kings, the
Chancery became a law court, the office of Master
of the Rolls had been that of a judge of first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
instance. In 1881 its character was changed,
and its occupant placed at the head of the
Court of Appeal. Thus it was as an appellate
judge that Jessel latterly sat, giving no less
satisfaction in that capacity than in his former
one, and being indeed confessedly the strongest
judicial intellect (except Lord Cairns) on the
Bench. Outside his professional duties, his chief
interest was in the University of London, at
which he had himself graduated. He was a
member of its senate, and busied himself with its
examinations, being up till the last excessively
fond of work, and finding that of a judge who
sits for five or six hours daily insufficient to
satisfy his appetite. He was not what would
be called a highly cultivated man, although he
knew a great deal beyond the field of law,
mathematics, for instance, and Hebrew literature
and botany, for he had been brought up in
a not very refined circle, and had been absorbed
in legal work during the best years of his life.
But his was an intelligence of extraordinary power
and flexibility, eminently practical, as the Semitic
intellect generally is, and yet thoroughly scientific.
And he was also one of those strong natures who
make themselves disliked while they are fighting
their way to the top, but grow more genial and
more tolerant when they have won what they
sought, and perceive that others admit their pre-eminence.
The services which he rendered as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
judge illustrate not only the advantage of throwing
open all places to all comers&mdash;the bigotry of
an elder day excluded the Jews from judicial office
altogether&mdash;but also the benefit of having a judge
at least equal in ability to the best of those who
practise before him. It was because Jessel was
so easily master in his court that so large and
important a part of the judicial business of the
country was, during many years, despatched with
a swiftness and a success seldom equalled in the
annals of the English Courts.</p>

<h2>LORD CHANCELLOR CAIRNS</h2>
</div>
<p>Hugh M&rsquo;Calmont Cairns, afterwards Earl
Cairns (born 1819, died 1885), was one of three
remarkable Scoto-Irishmen whom the north-east
corner of Ulster gave to the United Kingdom
in one generation, and each of whom was foremost
in the career he entered. Lord Lawrence
was the strongest of Indian or Colonial administrators,
and did more than any other man to
save India for England in the crisis of the great
Mutiny of 1857. Lord Kelvin has been, since the
death of Charles Darwin, the first among British
men of science. Lord Cairns was unquestionably
the greatest judge of the Victorian epoch, perhaps
of the nineteenth century.<a name='FNanchor_0023' id='FNanchor_0023'></a><a href='#Footnote_0023' class='fnanchor'>[28]</a> His name and family
were of Scottish origin, but he combined with the
shrewd sense and grim persistency of Scotland
some measure of the keen partisanship which
marks the Irish Orangeman. Born an Episcopalian,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
he grew up a Tory in politics, an earnest
Low-Church Evangelical in religion; nor did his
opinions in either respect ever seem to alter
during his long life. His great abilities were
perceived both at school (he was educated at
the Academy in Belfast) and at college (Trinity
College, Dublin), and so much impressed the
counsel in whose chambers he studied for a
year in London, that he strongly dissuaded the
young man from returning to Dublin to practise
at the Irish bar, promising him a brilliant career
on the wider theatre of England. The prediction
was verified by the rapidity with which Cairns,
who had, no doubt, the advantage of influential
connections in the City of London, rose into
note. He obtained (as a Conservative) a seat
in Parliament for his native town of Belfast
when only thirty-three years of age, and was
appointed Solicitor-General to Lord Derby&rsquo;s
second Ministry six years later&mdash;a post which
few eminent lawyers have reached before fifty.
In the House of Commons, though at first
somewhat diffident and nervous, he soon proved
himself a powerful as well as ready speaker, and
would doubtless have remained in an assembly
where he was rendering such valuable services
to his party but for the weakness of his lungs
and throat, which had threatened his life since
boyhood. He therefore accepted, in 1867, the
office of Lord Justice of Appeal, with a seat in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
the House of Lords, and next year was made
Lord Chancellor by Mr. Disraeli, then Prime
Minister, who dismissed Lord Chelmsford, then
Chancellor, in order to have the benefit of Cairns&rsquo;s
help as a colleague. Disraeli subsequently caused
him to be raised to an earldom.</p>
<p>After Lord Derby&rsquo;s death, Cairns led the
Tory party in the House of Lords for a time
(replacing the Duke of Richmond when the latter
quitted the leadership), but his very pronounced
Low-Church proclivities, coupled perhaps with a
certain jealousy felt toward him as a newcomer,
prevented him from becoming popular there, so
that ultimately the leadership of that House settled
itself in the hands of Lord Salisbury, a statesman
not superior to Cairns in political judgment or
argumentative power, but without the disadvantage
of being a lawyer, possessing a wider range
of political experience, and in closer sympathy
with the feelings and habits of the titled order.
There were, however, some peers who, when
Lord Beaconsfield died in 1881, desired to see
Cairns chosen to succeed him in the leadership
of the Tory party, then in opposition, in the
Upper Chamber. Whether in opposition or in
power, Cairns took a prominent part in all &ldquo;full-dress&rdquo;
political debates in the House of Lords
and in the discussion of legal measures, and was
indeed so absolutely master of the Chamber when
such measures came under discussion, that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
Liberal Government, during the years from 1868
to 1874, and again from 1880 till 1885, could
carry no legal reforms through the House of
Lords except by his permission, which, of
course, was never given when such reforms
could seem to affect any political issue. Yet
the vehemence of his party feeling did not overcast
his judgment. It was mainly through his
interposition (aided by that of Archbishop Tait)
that the House of Lords consented to pass the
Irish Church Bill of 1869, a measure which
Cairns, of course heartily disliking it, accepted
for the sake of saving to the disestablished
Church a part of her funds, since these might
have been lost had the Bill been rejected then
and passed next year by an angrier House of
Commons. Of all the members of Disraeli&rsquo;s
two Cabinets, he was the one whom Disraeli
himself had been wont most to trust and
most to rely on. In January 1874, when Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s suddenly announced dissolution of
Parliament startled all England one Saturday
morning, Disraeli, who heard of it while still in
bed, was at first frightened, thinking that the
Liberal leader had played his cards boldly and
well, and would carry the elections. When his
chief party manager came to see him he was
found restless and dejected, and cried out, &ldquo;Send
for Cairns at once.&rdquo; Lord Cairns was sent for,
came full of vigour, hope, and counsel, and after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
an hour&rsquo;s talk so restored the confidence of his
ally that Disraeli sat down in the best spirits to
compose his electoral manifesto. As everybody
knows, Cairns&rsquo;s forecast was right, and the Tories
won the general election by a large majority.</p>
<p>For political success Cairns had several qualities
of the utmost value&mdash;a stately presence, a clear
head, a resolute will, and splendid oratorical gifts.
He was not an imaginative speaker, nor fitted
to touch the emotions; but he had a matchless
power of statement, and a no less matchless
closeness and cogency in argument. In the
famous controversies of 1866, he showed himself
the clearest and most vigorous thinker among
the opponents of reform, more solid, if less
brilliant, than was Robert Lowe. His diction,
without being exceptionally choice, was pure and
precise, and his manner had a dignity and weight
which seemed to compel your attention even
when the matter was uninteresting. A voice
naturally neither strong nor musical, and sometimes
apt to sound hollow (for the chest was weak),
was managed with great skill; action and gesture
were used sparingly but effectively, and the tall
well-built figure and strongly-marked, somewhat
Roman features, with their haughty and distant
air, deepened the impression of power, courage,
and resolution which was characteristic of the
whole man.</p>
<p>The qualities of oratory I have described
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
may seem better fitted to a comparatively sober
and sedate assembly like the House of Lords
than to a changeful and excitable assembly
like the House of Commons. Yet, in point of
fact, Cairns spoke better in the Commons than he
did afterwards in the Lords, and would have left
an even higher oratorical reputation had his
career in the popular House been longer and his
displays more numerous. The reason seems to be
that the heat of that House warmed his somewhat
chilly temperament, and roused him to a more
energetic and ardent style of speaking than was
needed in the Upper Chamber, where he and
his friends, commanding a large majority, had
things all their own way. In the House of
Commons he confronted a crowd of zealous
adversaries, and put forth all the forces of his
logic and rhetoric to overcome them. In the more
languid House of Lords he was apt to be didactic,
sometimes even prolix. He overproved his own
case without feeling the need, which he would have
felt in the Commons, of overthrowing the case of
the other side; his manner wanted animation and
his matter variety. Still, he was a great speaker,
greater as a speaker upon legal topics, where a
power of exact statement and lucid exposition is
required, than any one he left behind him.</p>
<p>Why, it may be asked, with these gifts, and
with so much firmness and energy of character,
did he not play an even more conspicuous part
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
in politics, and succeed, after Lord Beaconsfield&rsquo;s
death, to the chieftaincy of the Tory party?
The answer is to be found partly in the prejudice
which still survives in England against legal
politicians, partly in certain defects of his own
personality. Although sincerely pious, and exemplary
in all the relations of domestic life, he
was ungenial and unbending in social intercourse.
Few equally eminent men of our time have had so
narrow a circle of personal friends. There was a
dryness, a coldness, and an appearance of reserve
and hauteur about his manner which repelled
strangers, and kept acquaintanceship from ripening
into friendship. To succeed as a political leader, a
man must usually (I do not say invariably, because
there are a few remarkable instances&mdash;Mr. Parnell&rsquo;s
would appear to be one of them&mdash;to the contrary)
at least seem sympathetic; must be able to enter
into the feelings of his followers, and show himself
interested in them not merely as party
followers, but as human beings. There must be
a certain glow, a certain effluence of feeling about
him, which makes them care for him and rally
to him as a personality. Whether Lord Cairns
wanted warmth of heart, or whether it was that an
inner warmth failed to pierce the cloak of reserve
and pride which he habitually wore, I do not
attempt to determine. But the defect told heavily
against him. He never became a familiar figure
to the mass of his party, a person whose features
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
they knew, at whose name they would cheer;
and nowadays all leaders, to whatever party they
belong, find a source of strength in winning this
kind of popularity. The quality which Americans
call magnetism is perhaps less essential
in England than in the country which distinguished
and named it; but it is helpful even
in England. Cairns, though an Irishman, was
wholly without it.</p>
<p>In the field of law, where passion has no
place, and even imagination must be content
to move with clipped wings along the ground,
the merits of Lord Cairns&rsquo;s intellect showed
to the best advantage. At the Chancery bar he
was one of a trio who had not been surpassed, if
ever equalled, during the nineteenth century, and
whom none of our now practising advocates rivals.
The other two were Mr., afterwards Lord Justice,
Rolt, and Mr. Roundell Palmer, afterwards Lord
Chancellor Selborne. All were admirable lawyers,
but, of the three, Rolt excelled in his spirited presentation
of a case and in the lively vigour of his
arguments. Palmer was conspicuous for exhaustless
ingenuity, and for a subtlety which sometimes
led him away into reasonings too fine for the
court to follow. Cairns was broad, massive,
convincing, with a robust urgency of logic which
seemed to grasp and fix you, so that while he
spoke you could fancy no conclusion possible save
that toward which he moved. His habit was to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
seize upon what he deemed the central and vital
point of the case, throwing the whole force of
his argument upon that one point, and holding
the judge&rsquo;s mind fast to it.</p>
<p>All these famous men were raised to the judicial
bench. Rolt remained there for a few months
only, so his time was too short to permit him to
enrich our jurisprudence and leave a memory of
himself in the Reports. Palmer sat in the House
of Lords from his accession to the Chancellorship
in 1872 till his death in 1896, and, while fully
sustaining his reputation as a man of eminent
legal capacity, was, on the whole, less brilliant as a
judge than he had been as an advocate, because a
tendency to over-refinement is more dangerous
in the judicial than in the forensic mind. He
made an admirable Chancellor, and showed himself
more industrious and more zealous for law
reform than did Cairns. But Cairns was the
greater judge, and became to the generation
which argued before him a model of judicial excellence.
In hearing a cause he was singularly
patient, rarely interrupting counsel, and then only
to put some pertinent question. His figure was
so still, his countenance so impassive, that people
sometimes doubted whether he was really attending
to all that was urged at the bar. But when
the time came for him to deliver judgment,
which in the House of Lords is done in the form
of a speech addressed to the House in moving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
or supporting a motion that is to become the judgment
of the tribunal, it was seen how fully he had
apprehended the case in all its bearings. His
deliverances were never lengthy, but they were
exhaustive. They went straight to the vital principles
on which the question turned, stated these
in the most luminous way, and applied them with
unerring exactitude to the particular facts. It is
as a storehouse of fundamental doctrines that his
judgments are so valuable. They disclose less
knowledge of case-law than do those of some other
judges; but Cairns was not one of the men who
love cases for their own sake, and he never cared
to draw upon, still less to display, more learning
than was needed for the matter in hand. It
was in the grasp of the principles involved, in
the breadth of view which enabled him to see
these principles in their relation to one another, in
the precision of the logic which drew conclusions
from the principles, in the perfectly lucid language
in which the principles were expounded and
applied, that his strength lay. Herein he surpassed
the most eminent of contemporary judges,
the then Master of the Rolls, for while Jessel had
perhaps a quicker mind than Cairns, he had not so
wide a mind, nor one so thoroughly philosophical
in the methods by which it moved.</p>
<p>Outside the spheres of law and politics, Cairns&rsquo;s
only interest was in religion. He did not seem,
although a good classical scholar and a competent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
mathematician, to care either for letters or for
science. But he was a Sunday-school teacher
nearly all his life. Prayer-meetings were held
at his house, at which barristers, not otherwise
known for their piety, but believed to desire
county court judgeships, were sometimes seen.
He used to take the chair at missionary and
other philanthropic meetings. He was surrounded
by evangelisers and clergymen. But
nothing softened the austerity or melted the ice
of his manners. Neither did the great position
he had won seem to give a higher and broader
quality to his statesmanship. It is true that in
law he was wholly free from the partisanship
which tinged his politics. No one was more
perfectly fair upon the bench; no one more
honestly anxious to arrive at a right decision.
And as a law reformer, although he effected less
than might have been hoped from his abilities or
expected from the absolute sway which he exercised
while Chancellor in Lord Beaconsfield&rsquo;s
Government from 1874 to 1880, he was free from
prejudice, and willing to sweep away antiquated
rules or usages if they seemed to block the
channel of speedy justice. But in politics this
impartiality and elevation vanished even after he
had risen so high that he did not need to humour
the passions or confirm the loyalty of his own
associates. He seemed to be not merely a party
man, which an English politician is forced to be,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
because if he stands outside party he cannot effect
anything, but a partisan&mdash;that is, a man wholly
devoted to his party, who sees everything through
its eyes, and argues every question in its interests.
He gave the impression of being either unwilling
or unable to rise to a higher and more truly
national view, and sometimes condescended to
arguments whose unsoundness his penetrating
intellect could hardly have failed to detect. His
professional tone had been blameless, but at the
bar the path of rectitude is plain and smooth, and
a scrupulous mind finds fewer cases of conscience
present themselves in a year than in Parliament
within a month. Yet if in this respect Cairns
failed to reach a level worthy of his splendid
intellect, the defect was due not to any selfish
view of his own interest, but rather to the narrowness
of the groove into which his mind had fallen,
and to the atmosphere of Orange sentiment in
which he had grown up. As a politician he is
already beginning to be forgotten; but as a judge
he will be held in honourable remembrance as
one of the five or six most brilliant luminaries
that have adorned the English bench since those
remote days<a name='FNanchor_0024' id='FNanchor_0024'></a><a href='#Footnote_0024' class='fnanchor'>[29]</a> in which the beginning of legal

<a name='BISHOP_FRASER' id='BISHOP_FRASER'></a>
<h2>BISHOP FRASER</h2>
</div>
<p>James Fraser, Bishop of Manchester from 1870
till 1885, was born in Gloucestershire, of a Scottish
family, in 1818, and died at Manchester in 1885.<a name='FNanchor_0025' id='FNanchor_0025'></a><a href='#Footnote_0025' class='fnanchor'>[30]</a>
He took no prominent part in ecclesiastical politics,
and no part at all in general politics. Though
a sound classical scholar in the old-fashioned
sense of the term&mdash;he won the Ireland University
Scholarship at Oxford, then and still the most
conspicuous prize in the field of classics&mdash;he was
not an exceptionally cultivated man, and he never
wrote anything except official reports and episcopal
charges. Neither was he, although a ready
and effective speaker, gifted with the highest
kind of eloquence. Neither was he a profound
theologian. Yet his character and career are of
permanent interest, for he created not merely a
new episcopal type, but (one may almost say)
a new ecclesiastical type within the Church of
England.</p>
<p>Till some sixty or seventy years ago the
normal English bishop was a rich, dignified, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
rather easy-going magnate, aristocratic in his
tastes and habits, moderate in his theology, sometimes
to the verge of indifferentism, quite as much
a man of the world as a pastor of souls. He had
usually obtained his preferment by his family connections,
or by some service rendered to the court
or a political chief&mdash;perhaps even by solicitation
or intrigue. Now and then eminence in learning
or literature raised a man to the bench: there
were, for instance, the &ldquo;Greek play&rdquo; bishops,
such as Dr. Monk of Gloucester, whose fame
rested on their editions of the Attic dramatists;
and the <i>Quarterly Review</i> bishops, such as
Dr. Copleston, of Llandaff, whose powerful pen,
as well as his wise administration of the great
Oxford College over which he long presided,
amply justified his promotion. So even in the
eighteenth century the illustrious Butler had
been Bishop of Durham, as in Ireland the
illustrious Berkeley had been Bishop of Cloyne.
But, on the whole, the bishops of our grandfathers&rsquo;
days were more remarkable for their
prudence and tact, their adroitness or suppleness,
than for intellectual or moral superiority to
the rest of the clergy. Their own upper-class
world, and the middle class which, in the main,
took its view of English institutions from the
upper class, respected them as a part of the solid
fabric of English society, but they were a mark
for Radical invective and for literary sneers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
Their luxurious pomp and ease were incessantly
contrasted with the simplicity of the apostles and
the poverty of curates, and the abundance among
them of the gifts that befit the senate or the
drawing-room was compared with the rarity of the
graces that adorn a saint. The comparison was
hardly fair, for saints are scarce, and a good bishop
needs some qualities which a saint may lack.</p>
<p>That revival within the Church of England
which went on in various forms from 1800 till
1870, at first Low Church or Evangelical in its
tendencies, latterly more conspicuously High
Church and Ritualist, began from below and
worked upwards till at length it reached the
bishops. Lord Palmerston, influenced by Lord
Shaftesbury, filled the vacant sees that fell to him
with earnest men, sometimes narrow, sometimes
deficient in learning, but often good preachers, and
zealous for the doctrines they held. When the
High Churchmen found their way to the Bench,
as they did very largely under Lord Derby&rsquo;s and
Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s rule, they showed as much theological
zeal as the Evangelicals, and perhaps more
talent for administration. The popular idea of
what may be expected from a bishop rose, and the
bishops rose with the idea. As Bishop of Oxford,
Dr. Samuel Wilberforce was among the first to
make himself powerfully felt through his diocese.
His example told upon other prelates, and prime
ministers grew more anxious to select energetic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
and popular men. So it came to pass that the
bishops began to be among the foremost men in
the Church of England. Some, like Dr. Magee
of Peterborough, and afterwards of York, were
brilliant orators; some, like Dr. Lightfoot of
Durham, profound scholars; some, like Dr.
Temple of Exeter, able and earnest administrators.
There remained but few who had not
some good claim to the dignity they enjoyed.
So it may be said, when one compares the later
Victorian bishops with their Georgian predecessors,
that no class in the country has improved
more. Few now sneer at them, for no set of men
take a more active and more creditable part in the
public business of the country. Their incomes,
curtailed of late years in the case of the richer
sees, are no more than sufficient for the expenses
which fall upon them, and they work as hard as
any other men for their salaries. Though the
larger sees have been divided, the reduction of
the toil of bishops thus effected has been less than
the addition to it due to the growth of population
and the increased activity of the clergy. The
only defect which the censorious still impute to
them is a certain episcopal conventionality, a disposition
to try to please everybody by the use of
vague professional language, a tendency to think
too much about the Church as a church establishment,
and to defer to clerical opinion when they
ought to speak and act with an independence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
born of their individual opinions. Some of them,
as, for instance, the three I have just mentioned,
were not open to this reproach. It was one
of the merits and charms of Fraser that he was
absolutely free from any such tendency. Other
men, such as Bishop Lightfoot, have been not
less eminent models of the virtues which ought
to characterise a great Christian pastor; but
Fraser (appointed some time before Lightfoot)
was the first to be an absolutely unconventional
and, so to speak, unepiscopal bishop. His career
marked a new departure and set a new example.</p>
<p>Fraser spent the earlier years of his manhood
in Oxford, as a tutor in Oriel College, teaching
Thucydides and Aristotle. Like many of his
Oxford contemporaries, he continued through life
to think on Aristotelian lines, and one could trace
them in his sermons. He then took in succession
two college livings, both in quiet nooks in the
South of England, and discharged for nearly
twenty years the simple duties of a parish priest,
unknown to the great world, but making himself
beloved by the people, and doing his best to
improve their condition. The zeal he had shown
in promoting elementary education caused him to
be appointed (in 1865) by the Schools Inquiry
Commissioners to be their Assistant Commissioner
to examine the common-school system of
the United States, and the excellence of his report
thereon attracted the notice of the late Lord
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
Lyttelton, one of those Commissioners who were
then sitting to investigate the state of secondary
education in England. His report long remained
by far the best general picture of American
schools, conspicuous for its breadth of view, its
clearness of statement, its sympathetic insight
into conditions unlike those he had known in
England. On the recommendation (as has been
generally believed) of Lord Lyttelton and of the
then Bishop of Salisbury, who was a friend of
Dr. Fraser&rsquo;s, Mr. Gladstone, at that time Prime
Minister, appointed him Bishop of Manchester
in 1870. The diocese of Manchester, which
included all Lancashire except Liverpool and a
small district in the extreme north of the county,
had been under a bishop who, although an able
and learned man, capable of making himself
agreeable when he pleased, was personally unpopular,
and had done little beyond his formal
duties. He lived in a large and handsome
country-house some miles from the city, and was
known by sight to very few of its inhabitants.
(I was familiar with Lancashire in those days, for
I had visited all its grammar-schools as Assistant
Commissioner to the Commission just referred
to, and there was hardly a trace to be found in
it of the bishop&rsquo;s action.) Fraser had not been
six months in the county before everything was
changed. The country mansion was sold, and he
procured a modest house in one of the less fashionable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
suburbs of the city. He preached twice
every Sunday, usually in some parish church, and
spent the week in travelling up and down his
diocese, so that the days were few in which he
was not on the railway. He stretched out the
hand of friendship to the Dissenters (numerous
and powerful in the manufacturing districts), who
had hitherto regarded a bishop as a sort of natural
enemy, gained their confidence, and soon became
as popular with them as with the laity of his
own Church. He associated himself with all
the works of benevolence or public utility which
were in progress, subscribed to all so far as his
means allowed, and was always ready to speak
at a meeting on behalf of any good enterprise.
He dealt in his sermons with the topics of the
day, avoiding party politics, but speaking his
mind on all social and moral questions with a
freedom which sometimes involved him in passing
difficulties, but stimulated the minds of his hearers,
and gave the impression of his own perfect
candour and perfect courage. He used to say
that as he felt it his duty to speak wherever he
was asked to do so, he must needs speak without
preparation, and must therefore expect sometimes
to get into hot water; that this was a pity, but
it was not his fault that he was reported, and
that it was better to run the risk of making
mistakes and suffering for them than to refuse
out of self-regarding caution to give the best of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
himself to the diocese. He had that true modesty
which makes a man willing to do a thing imperfectly,
at the risk of lowering his intellectual
reputation. He knew that he was neither a deep
thinker nor a finished preacher, and was content
to be what he was, so long as he could perform
the work which it was in him to do. He lost
no opportunity of meeting the working men,
would go and talk to them in the yards of the
mills or at the evening gatherings of mechanics&rsquo;
institutes; and when any misfortune befell, such
as a colliery accident, he was often among the
first who reached the spot to help the survivors
and comfort the widows. He made no difference
between rich and poor, showed no wish to be a
guest in the houses of the great, and treated the
poorest curate with as much courtesy as the most
pompous county magnate. His work in Lancashire
seldom allowed him to appear in the House
of Lords; and this he regretted, not that he
desired to speak there, but because, as he said,
&ldquo;Whether or not bishops do Parliament good,
Parliament does bishops good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a simple, earnest, active course of conduct
told upon the feelings of the people who read of
his words and doings. But even greater was the
impression made by his personality upon those
who saw him. He was a tall, well-built man,<a name='FNanchor_0026' id='FNanchor_0026'></a><a href='#Footnote_0026' class='fnanchor'>[31]</a>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
erect in figure, with a quick eye, a firm step, a
ruddy face, an expression of singular heartiness
and geniality. He seemed always cheerful, and,
in spite of his endless labours, always fresh and
strong. His smile and the grasp of his hand
put you into good-humour with yourself and the
world; if you were dispirited, they led you out
of shadow into sunlight. He was not a great
reader, and had no time for sustained and searching
thought; yet he seemed always abreast of
what was passing in the world, and to know what
the books and articles and speeches of the day
contained, although he could not have found time
to peruse them. With strong opinions of his own,
he was anxious to hear yours; a ready and eager
talker, yet a willing listener. His oratory was
plain, with few flights of rhetoric, but it was direct
and vigorous, free from conventional phrases,
charged with clear good sense and genuine feeling,
and capable, when his feeling was exceptionally
strong, of rising to eloquence. He had a
ready sense of humour, the best proof of which
was that he relished a joke against himself.<a name='FNanchor_0027' id='FNanchor_0027'></a><a href='#Footnote_0027' class='fnanchor'>[32]</a>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
However, the greatest charm, both of his public
and private talk, was the transparent sincerity
and honesty that shone through it. His mind
was like a crystal pool of water in a mountain
stream. You saw everything that was in it, and
saw nothing that was mean or unworthy. This
sincerity and freshness made his character not
only manly, but lovable and beautiful, beautiful
in its tenderness, its loyalty to his friends, its
devotion to truth.</p>
<p>His conscientious anxiety to say nothing more
than he thought was apt to make him an embarrassing
ally. It happened more than once
that when he came to speak at a public meeting
on behalf of some enterprise, he was not content,
like most men, to set forth its merits and claims,
but went on to dwell upon possible drawbacks
or dangers, so that the more ardent friends of
the scheme thought he was pouring cold water
on them, and called him a Balaam reversed. In
a political assembly he would have been an <i>enfant
terrible</i> whom his party would have feared to put
up to speak; but as people in the diocese got to
know that this was his way, they only smiled at
his too ingenuous honesty. As he spoke with no
preparation, and was naturally impulsive, he now
and then spoke unadvisedly, and received a good
deal of newspaper censure. But he was never
involved in real trouble by these speeches. As
Dean Stanley wrote to him, &ldquo;You have a singular
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
gift of going to the very verge of imprudence and
yet never crossing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one will wonder that such a character, set
in a conspicuous place, and joined to extraordinary
activity and zeal, should have produced an immense
effect on the people of his city and diocese.
Since Nonconformity arose in England in the
seventeenth century, no bishop, perhaps, indeed
no man, whether cleric or layman, had done so
much to draw together people of different religious
persuasions and help them to realise their common
Christianity. Densely populated South Lancashire
is practically one huge town, and he was its
foremost citizen; the most instant in all good
works; the one whose words were most sure to
find attentive listeners. This was because he
spoke, I will not say as a layman, but simply
as a Christian, never claiming for himself any
special authority in respect either of his sacerdotal
character or his official position. No English
prelate before him had been so welcome to all
classes and sections; none was so much lamented
by the masses of the people. But it is a significant
fact that he was from first to last more
popular with the laity than with the clergy. Not
that there was ever any slur on his orthodoxy.
He began life as a moderate High Churchman,
and gradually verged, half unconsciously, toward
what would be called a Broad-Church position;
maintaining the claim of the Anglican Church to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
undertake, and her duty to hold herself responsible
for, the education of the people, and upholding
her status as an establishment, but dwelling little
on minor points of doctrinal difference, and seeming
to care still less for external observances or
points of ritual. This displeased the Anglo-Catholic
party, and even among other sections of
the clergy there was a kind of feeling that the
Bishop was not sufficiently clerical, did not set full
store by the sacerdotal side of his office, and did
not think enough about ecclesiastical questions.</p>
<p>He was, I think, the first bishop who greeted
men of science as fellow-workers for truth, and
declared that Christianity had not, and could not
have, anything to fear from scientific inquiry.
This has often been said since, but in 1870 it was
so novel that it drew from Huxley a singularly
warm and impressive recognition. He was one
of the first bishops to condemn the system of
theological tests in the English universities. He
even declared that &ldquo;it was an evil hour when
the Church thought herself obliged to add to or
develop the simple articles of the Apostles&rsquo; Creed.&rdquo;
These deliverances, which any one can praise
now, alarmed a large section of the Church of
England then; nor was the bishop&rsquo;s friendliness
to Dissenters favourably regarded by those who
deny to Dissenting pastors the title of Christian
ministers.<a name='FNanchor_0028' id='FNanchor_0028'></a><a href='#Footnote_0028' class='fnanchor'>[33]</a></p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></div>
<p>The gravest trouble of his life arose in connection
with legal proceedings which he felt bound
to take in the case of a Ritualist clergyman
who had persisted in practices apparently illegal.
Fraser, though personally the most tolerant of
men to those who differed from his own theological
views, felt bound to enforce the law, because
it was the law, and was at once assailed unjustly,
as well as bitterly, by those who sympathised with
the offending clergyman, and who could not, or
would not, understand that a bishop, like other
persons in an official position, may hold it his
absolute duty to carry out the directions of the
law whether or no he approves the law, and at
whatever cost to himself. These attacks were
borne with patience and dignity. He was never
betrayed into recriminations, and could the more
easily preserve his calmness, because he felt no
animosity.</p>
<p>A bishop may be a power outside his own
religious community even in a country where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
the clergy are separated as a caste from the lay
people. Such men as Dupanloup in France show
that. So too he may be a mighty moral and
religious force outside his own religious community
in a country where there is no church
established or endowed by the State. The
example of Dr. Phillips Brooks in the United
States shows that. But Dupanloup would have
been eminent and influential had he not been a
clergyman at all; and Dr. Brooks was the most
inspiring preacher and the most potent leader of
religious thought in America long before, in
the last years of his life, he reluctantly consented
to accept the episcopal office. Fraser, not so
gifted by nature as either of those men, would
have had little chance of doing the work he did
save in a country where the existence of an
ancient establishment secures for one of its dignitaries
a position of far-reaching influence. When
the gains and losses to a nation of the retention
of a church establishment are reckoned up, this
may be set down among the gains.</p>
<p>If the Church of England possessed more
leaders like Tait, Fraser, and Lightfoot&mdash;the
statesman, the citizen, and the scholar&mdash;in the
characters and careers of all of whom one finds
the common mark of a catholic and pacific spirit,
she would have no need to fear any assaults of
political foes, no temptation to ally herself with
any party, but might stand as an establishment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
until, after long years, by the general wish of her
own people, as well as of those who are without,
she passed peaceably into the position of being
the first in honour, numbers, and influence among
a group of Christian communities, all equally free
from State control.</p>
<p>Fraser&rsquo;s example showed how much an attitude
of unpretending simplicity and friendliness to all
sects and classes may do to mitigate the jealousy
and suspicion which still embitter the relations of
the different religious bodies in England, and
which work for evil even in its politics. He
created, as Dean Stanley said, a new type of
episcopal excellence: and why should not originality
be shown in the conception and discharge of
an office as well as in the sphere of pure thought
or of literary creation?</p>

<h2>SIR STAFFORD HENRY NORTHCOTE, EARL OF IDDESLEIGH<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor2">[34]</a></h2>
</div>
<p>Sir Stafford Northcote (born 1818, died 1887)
belonged to a type of politician less common
among us than it used to be, and likely to
become still more rare as England grows more
democratic&mdash;the county gentleman of old family
and good estate, who receives and profits by a
classical education at one of the ancient universities,
who is at an early age returned to
Parliament in respect of his social position in
his county, who has leisure to cultivate himself
for statesmanship, who has tastes and
resources outside the sphere of politics. Devonshire,
whence he came, has preserved more
of the old features of English country life
than the central and northern parts of England,
where manufactures and the growth of population
have swept away the venerable remains of
feudalism. In Devonshire the old families are
still deeply respected by the people. They are
so intermarried that most of them have ties of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
kinship with all their neighbours. Few rich
parvenus have intruded among them; society is
therefore exceptionally easy, simple, and unostentatious.
There is still a strong local patriotism,
which makes every Devonshire man, whatever
his political prepossessions, proud of other Devonshire
men who rise to eminence, and which
exerts a wholesome influence on the tone of
manners and social intercourse. Northcote was a
thorough Devonshire man, who loved his county
and knew its dialect: his Devonshire stories,
told with the strong accent he could assume,
were the delight of any company that could
tempt him to repeat them. He was immensely
popular in the county, and had well earned his
popularity by his pleasant neighbourly ways, as
well as by his attention to county business and
to the duties of a landowner.</p>
<p>He had the time-honoured training of the
good old English type, was a schoolboy at
Eton, went thence to Oxford, won the highest
distinctions as a scholar, and laid the foundations
of a remarkably wide knowledge of modern
as well as ancient literature. He served his
apprenticeship to statesmanship as private secretary
to Mr. Gladstone, who was then (1843)
a member of Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;s Government.
When the great schism in the Tory party took
place over the question of free trade in corn, he
was not yet in Parliament, and therefore was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
not driven to choose between Peel and the
Protectionists. In 1855, when he first entered
the House of Commons, that question was settled
and gone, so there was no inconsistency in his
entering the Tory ranks although himself a
decided Free Trader. He was not a man who
would have elbowed his way upward. But elbows
were not needed. His abilities, as well as his
industry and the confidence he inspired, speedily
brought him to the top. He was appointed
Secretary to the Treasury in 1859, entered the
Cabinet in 1866, when a new Tory Ministry
was formed under Lord Derby; and when in
1876 Mr. Disraeli retired to the House of Lords,
he became, being then Chancellor of the Exchequer,
leader of the majority in the House
of Commons, while Mr. Gathorne Hardy, the
only other person who had been thought of
as suitable for that post, received a peerage.
Mr. Hardy was a more forcible and rousing
speaker, but Northcote had more varied accomplishments
and a fuller mastery of official work.
Disraeli said that he had &ldquo;the largest parliamentary
knowledge of any man he had met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As an administrator, Sir Stafford Northcote
was diligent, judicious, and free from any taint
of jobbery. He sought nothing for himself;
did not abuse his patronage; kept the public
interests steadily before his mind. He was considerate
to his subordinates, and gracious to all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
men. He never grudged labour, although there
might be no prospect of winning credit by it.
Scrupulous in discharging his duties to his
party, he overtaxed his strength by speaking
constantly at public meetings in the country, a
kind of work he must have disliked, and for
which he was ill fitted by the moderation of his
views and of his language. Parliament is not a
good place for the pursuit of pure truth, but the
platform is still less favourable to that quest. It
was remarked of him that even in party gatherings,
where invective against political opponents
is apt to be expected and relished, he argued
fairly, and never condescended to abuse.</p>
<p>As a Parliamentarian he had two eminent
merits&mdash;immense knowledge and admirable
readiness. He had been all his life a keen
observer and a diligent student; and as his
memory was retentive, all that he had observed
or read stood at his command. In
questions of trade and finance, questions which,
owing, perhaps, to their increasing intricacy,
seem to be less and less frequently mastered
by practical politicians in England, he was
especially strong. No other man on his own
side in politics spoke on such matters with equal
authority, and the brunt of the battle fell on
him whenever they came up for discussion.
As he had now his old master for his chief
antagonist, the conflict was no easy one; but he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
never shrank from it. Not less remarkable was
his alertness in debate. His manner was indeed
somewhat ineffective, for it wanted both force
and variety. Sentence followed sentence in a
smooth and easy stream, always clear, always
grammatically correct, but with a flow too equably
unbroken. There were few impressive phrases,
few brilliant figures, few of those appeals to
passion with which it is necessary to warm and
rouse a large assembly. When the House grew
excited at the close of a long full-dress debate,
and Sir Stafford rose in the small hours of the
morning to wind it up on behalf of his party, men
felt that the ripple of his sweet voice, the softness
of his gentle manner, were not what the occasion
called for. But what he said was always to the
point and well worth hearing. No facts or
arguments suddenly thrown at him by opponents
disconcerted him; for there was sure to
be an answer ready. However weak his own
case might seem, his ingenuity could be relied
upon to strengthen it; however powerfully the
hostile case had been presented, he found weak
places in it and shook it down by a succession
of well-planted criticisms, each apparently small,
but damaging when taken all together, because
no one of them could be dismissed as irrelevant.</p>
<p>It was interesting to watch him as he sat on
the front bench, with his hat set so low on his brow
that it hid all the upper part of his face, while the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
lower part was covered by a thick yellowish-brown
beard, perfectly motionless, rarely taking a note
of what was said, and, to all appearance, the most
indifferent figure in the House. The only sign
of feeling which he gave was to be found in
his habit of thrusting each of his hands up the
opposite sleeve of his coat when Mr. Gladstone,
the only assailant whom he needed to fear, burst
upon him in a hailstorm of declamation. But
when he rose, one perceived that nothing had
escaped him. Every point which an antagonist
had made was taken up and dealt with; no point
that could aid his own contention was neglected;
and the fluent grace with which his discourse
swept along, seldom aided by a reference to
notes, was not more surprising than the unfailing
skill with which he shunned dangerous ground,
and put his propositions in a form which made
it difficult to contradict them. I remember to
have heard a member of the opposite party
remark, that nothing was more difficult than to
defend your argument from Northcote, because
he had the art of nibbling it away, admitting
a little in order to evade or overthrow the rest.</p>
<p>So much for his parliamentary aptitudes, which
were fully recognised before he rose to leadership.
But as it was his leadership that has given him a
place in history, I may dwell for a little upon the
way in which he filled that most trying as well
as most honourable post. He led the House&mdash;that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
is to say, the Ministerial majority&mdash;for four
sessions (1877-1880), and the Tory Opposition for
five and a half sessions (1880 to middle of 1885).
To lead the House of Commons a man must have,
over and above the qualities which make a good
debater, an unusual combination of talents. He
must be both bold and cautious, combative and
cool. He must take, on his own responsibility,
and on the spur of the moment, decisions which
commit the whole Ministry, and yet, especially if
he be not Prime Minister, he must consider how
far his colleagues will approve and implement his
action. He must put enough force and fire
into his speeches to rouse his own ranks and
intimidate (if he can) his opponents, yet must
have regard to the more timorous spirits among
his own supporters, going no further than he
feels they will follow, and must sometimes throw
a crafty fly over those in the Opposition whom
he thinks wavering or disaffected. Under the
fire of debate, perhaps while composing the
speech he has to make in reply, he must
consider not merely the audience before him
but also the effect his words will have when
they are read next morning in cold blood,
and, it may be, the effect not only in England
but abroad. Being responsible for the whole
conduct of parliamentary business, he must keep
a close watch upon every pending bill, and determine
how much of Government time shall be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
allotted to each, and in what order they shall be
taken, and how far the general feeling of the
House will let him go in seizing the hours usually
reserved for private members, and in granting or
refusing <a name='TC_1' id='TC_1'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'opportunies'">opportunities</ins> for discussing topics he would
prefer to have not discussed at all.</p>
<p>So far as prudence, tact, and knowledge of
business could enable him to discharge these
duties, Northcote discharged them admirably.
It was his good fortune to have behind him in
Lord Beaconsfield, who had recently gone to the
House of Lords, a chief of the whole party who
trusted him, and with whom he was on the best
terms. The immense authority of that chief
secured his own authority. His party was&mdash;as
the Tory party usually is&mdash;compact and loyal;
and his majority ample, so he had no reason
to fear defeat. In the conflicts that arose
over Eastern affairs in 1877-79, affairs at some
moments highly critical, he was cautious and
adroit, more cautious than Lord Beaconsfield,
sometimes repairing by moderate language the
harm which the latter&rsquo;s theatrical utterances
had done. When a group of Irish Nationalist
members, among whom Mr. Parnell soon came
to the front, began to evade the rules and
paralyse the action of the House by obstructive
tactics, he was less successful. Their
ingenuity baffled the Ministry, and brought the
House into sore straits. But it may be doubted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
whether any leader could have overcome the
difficulties of the position. It was a new
position. The old rules framed under quite
different conditions were not fit to check members
who, far from regarding the sentiments of
the House, avowed their purpose to reduce it to
impotence, and thereby obtain that Parliament
of their own, which could alone, as they held,
cure the ills of Ireland.</p>
<p>After ten years of struggle and experiment,
drastic remedies for obstruction were at last
devised; but in the then state of opinion within
the House, those remedies could not have been
carried. Members accustomed to the old state of
things could not for a good while make up their
minds to sacrifice part of their own privileges in
order to deal with a difficulty the source of which
they would not attempt to cure. On the whole,
therefore, though he was blamed at the time,
Northcote may be deemed to have passed creditably
through his first period of leadership.</p>
<p>It was when he had to lead his party in
Opposition, after April 1880, that his severest
trial came. To lead the minority is usually easier
than to lead the majority. A leader of the
Opposition also must, no doubt, take swift decisions
in the midst of a debate, must consider
how far he is pledging his party to a policy
which they may be required to maintain when
next they come into power, must endeavour to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
judge, often on scanty data, how many of his usual
or nominal supporters will follow him into the
lobby when a division is called, and how best he
can draw off some votes from among his opponents.
Still, delicate as this work is, it is not so hard as
that of the leader of the Government, for it is
rather critical than constructive, and a mistake
can seldom do irreparable mischief. Northcote,
however, had special difficulties to face. Mr.
Gladstone, still full of energy and fire, was
leading the majority. After a few months
Lord Beaconsfield&rsquo;s mantle no longer covered
Northcote (that redoubtable strategist died
in April 1881), and a small but active group
of Tory members set up an irregular skirmishing
Opposition on their own account, paying
little heed to his moderate counsels. The Tory
party was then furious at its unexpected defeat
at the election of 1880. It was full of fight, burning
for revenge, eager to denounce every trifling
error of the Ministry, and to give battle on small
as well as great occasions. Hence it resented
the calm and cautiously critical attitude which
Northcote took up. He had plenty of courage;
but he thought, as indeed most impartial observers
thought, that little was to be gained
by incessantly worrying an enemy so superior
in force and flushed with victory; that premature
assaults might consolidate a majority within
which there existed elements of discord; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
that it was wiser to wait till the Ministry should
begin to make mistakes and incur misfortunes in
the natural course of events, before resuming the
offensive against them. There is a natural tendency
to reaction in English popular opinion, and
a tendency to murmur against whichever party
may be in power. This tendency must soon
have told in favour of the Tories, with little
effort on their own part; and when it was already
manifest, a Parliamentary attack could have been
delivered with effect. Northcote&rsquo;s view and plan
were probably right, but, being too prone to yield
to pressure, and finding his hand forced, he
allowed himself to be drawn by the clamour of
his followers into aggressive operations, which,
nevertheless, himself not quite approving them,
he conducted in a half-hearted way. He had
not Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s power of doing excellently
what he hated to have to do. And it must be
admitted that from 1882 onwards, when troubles
in Ireland and oscillations in Egyptian policy
had begun to shake the credit of the Liberal
Ministry, he showed less fire and pugnacity than
the needs of the time required from a party
leader. In one thing the young men, who,
like Zulu warriors, wished to wash their spears,
were right and he was wrong. He conceived
that frequent attacks and a resort to obstructive
tactics would damage the Opposition in the eyes
of the country. Experience has shown that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
parties do not greatly suffer from the way they
fight their Parliamentary battles. Few people
follow the proceedings closely enough to know
when an Opposition deserves blame for prolonging
debate, or a Ministry for abuse of the closure.
So, too, in the United States it would seem that
neither the tyrannical action of a majority nor
filibustering by a minority shocks the nation.</p>
<p>Not only was Northcote&rsquo;s own temper pacific,
but he was too sweetly reasonable and too dispassionate
to be a successful leader in Opposition.
He felt that he was never quite a
party man. His mind was almost too judicial,
his courtesy too unfailing, his temper too unruffled,
his manner too unassuming. He did not
inspire awe or fear. Not only did he never
seek to give pain, even where pain might have
been a wholesome discipline for pushing selfishness&mdash;he
seemed incapable of irritation, and
bore with vexatious obstruction from some
members of the House, and mutinous attacks
from others who belonged to his own party,
when a spirit less kindly and forgiving might have
better secured his own authority and the dignity
of the assembly. He proceeded on the assumption,
an unsafe one, as he had too much reason
to know, that every one else was a gentleman
like himself, penetrated by the old traditions of
the House of Commons.</p>
<p>While superior to the prejudices of the old-fashioned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
wing of his party, he was too cautious
and conscientious to join those who sought to
lead it into demagogic courses. So far as
political opinions went, he might, had fortune
sent him into the world as the son of a Whig
family, have made an excellent Whig, removed
as far from high Toryism on the one hand as
from Radicalism on the other. There was, therefore,
a certain incompatibility between the man
and the position. Average partisans felt that a
leader so very reasonable was not in full sympathy
with them. Even his invincible optimism
displeased them. &ldquo;Hang that fellow Northcote!&rdquo;
said one of them; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s always seeing blue sky.&rdquo;
The militant partisans, whatever their opinions,
desired a pugnacious chief. That a leader
should draw the enemy&rsquo;s fire does him good with
his followers, and makes them rally to him. But
the fire of his opponents was hardly ever directed
against Northcote, even when controversy was
hottest. Had he possessed a more imperious
will, he might have overcome these difficulties,
because his abilities and experience were of
the highest value to his party, and his character
stood so high that the mass of sensible
Tories all over the country might perhaps have
rallied to him, if he had appealed to them
against the intrigues by which it was sought to
supplant him. He did not lack courage. But
he lacked what men call &ldquo;backbone.&rdquo; For
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
practical success, it is less fatal to fail in wisdom
than to fail in resolution. He had not that unquenchable
self-confidence which I have sought
to describe in Disraeli, and shall have to describe
in Parnell and in Gladstone. He yielded to pressure,
and people came to know that he would
yield to pressure.</p>
<p>The end of it was that the weakened prestige
and final fall of the Liberal Ministry were not
credited to his generalship, but rather to those
who had skirmished in advance of the main army.
That fall was in reality due neither to him nor to
them, but partly to the errors or internal divisions
of the Ministry itself, partly to causes such as the
condition of Ireland and the revolt of Arabi in
Egypt, for which Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Cabinet was
no more, perhaps less, to blame than many of
its predecessors. No Ministry of recent years
seemed, when it was formed, to have such a
source of strength in the abilities of the men who
composed it as did the Ministry of 1880. None
proved so persistently unlucky.</p>
<p>The circumstances under which Northcote&rsquo;s
leadership came to an end by his elevation to the
Upper House (June 1885) as Earl of Iddesleigh,
as well as those under which he was subsequently
(1887) removed from the post of Foreign Secretary
in the then Tory Ministry, evoked much
comment at the time, but some of the incidents
attending them have not yet been disclosed, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
they could not be discussed without bringing in
other persons with whom I am not here concerned.
Conscious of his own loyalty to his party, and
remembering his long and laborious services, he
felt those circumstances deeply; and they may have
hastened his death, which came very suddenly in
February 1887, and called forth a burst of sympathy
such as had not been seen since Peel perished by
an accident nearly forty years before.</p>
<p>In private life Northcote had the charm of
unpretending manners, coupled with abundant
humour, a store of anecdote, and a geniality
which came straight from the heart. No man
was a more agreeable companion. In 1884,
when the University of Edinburgh celebrated
its tercentenary, he happened to be Lord Rector,
and in that capacity had to preside over the
festivities. Although a stranger to Scotland,
and as far removed (for he was a decided
High Churchman) from sympathy with Scottish
Presbyterianism as he was removed in politics
from the Liberalism then dominant in Edinburgh,
he won golden opinions from the Scotch,
as well as from the crowd of foreign visitors, by
the tact and grace he showed in the discharge of
his duties, and the skill with which, putting off
the politician, he entered into the spirit of the
occasion as a lover of letters and learning.
Though political eminence had secured his election
to the office, every one felt that it would have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
hard to find in the ranks of literature and science
any one fitter to preside over such a gathering.</p>
<p>He left behind few in whom the capacities
of the administrator were so happily blended with
a philosophic judgment and a wide culture. It is
a combination which was inadequately appreciated
in his own person. Vehemence in controversy,
domineering audacity of purpose, the power of
moving crowds by incisive harangues, were the
qualities which the younger generation seemed
disposed to cultivate. They are qualities apt to be
valued in times of strife and change, times when
men are less concerned to study and apply principles
than to rouse the passions and consolidate
the organisation of their party, while dazzling the
nation by large promises or bold strokes of policy.
For such courses Northcote was not the man.
Were it to be observed of him that he was too
good for the work he had to do, it might be
answered that political leadership is work for
which no man can be too good, and that it was
rather because his force of will and his combativeness
were not commensurate with his other gifts,
that those other gifts did not have their full effect
and win their due success. Yet this at least may
be said, that if he had been less amiable, less fair-minded,
and less open-minded, he would have
retained his leadership to the end.</p>

<h2>CHARLES STEWART PARNELL</h2>
</div>
<p>Though I do not propose to write even the briefest
narrative of Parnell&rsquo;s life, but only to note certain
salient features of his intellect and character, it
may be well to state a few facts and dates; for in
these days of rapid change and hasty reading,
facts soon pass out of most men&rsquo;s memories,
leaving only vague impressions behind.<a name='FNanchor_0029' id='FNanchor_0029'></a><a href='#Footnote_0029' class='fnanchor'>[35]</a></p>
<p>He belonged to a family which, established at
Congleton in Cheshire, had at the time of the
Restoration migrated to Ireland, had settled on
an estate in Wicklow, and had produced in every
subsequent generation a person of distinction.
Thomas Parnell, the friend of Pope and Swift,
is still remembered by his poem of <i>The Hermit</i>.
Another Parnell (Sir John) was Chancellor of
the Irish Exchequer in the days of Henry
Grattan, whose opinions he shared. Another
(Sir Henry) was a leading Irish Liberal member
of the House of Commons, and died by his
own hand in 1842. Charles&rsquo;s father and grandfather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
figured less in the public eye. But
his mother was a remarkable woman, and
the daughter of a remarkable man, Commodore
Charles Stewart, one of the most brilliant naval
commanders on the American side in the war of
1812. Stewart was the son of a Scoto-Irishman
from Ulster, who had emigrated to America in
the middle of the eighteenth century; so there
was a strain of Scottish as well as a fuller strain
of English blood in the most powerful Irish
leader of recent times.</p>
<p>Parnell was born at Avondale, the family estate
in Wicklow, in 1846, and was educated mostly at
private schools in England. He spent some
months at Magdalene College, Cambridge, but,
having been rusticated for an affray in the street,
refused to return to the College, and finished his
education for himself at home. It was a very imperfect
education. He cared nothing for study,
and indeed showed interest only in mathematics
and cricket. In 1874 he stood as a candidate for
Parliament, but without success. When he had to
make a speech he broke down utterly. In 1875 he
was returned as member for the county of Meath,
and within two years had made his mark in the
House of Commons. In 1880 he was elected leader
of the Irish Parliamentary party, and ruled it and
his followers in Ireland with a rod of iron until
he was deposed, in 1890, at the instance of
the leaders of the English Liberal party, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
thought that the verdict against him in a divorce
suit in which he was co-respondent had fatally
discredited him in the eyes of the bulk of the
English Liberal party, and made co-operation
with him impossible. Refusing to resign his
leadership, he conducted a campaign in Ireland
against the majority of his former followers with
extraordinary energy till November 1891, when
he died of rheumatic fever after a short illness.
A constitution which had never been strong was
worn out by the ceaseless exertions and mental
tension of the last twelve months.</p>
<p>The whole of his political activity was comprised
within a period of sixteen years, during
ten of which he led the Irish Nationalist party,
exercising an authority more absolute than any
Irish leader had exercised before.</p>
<p>It has often been observed that he was not
Irish, and that he led the Irish people with success
just because he did not share their characteristic
weaknesses. But it is equally true that he was
not English. One always felt the difference
between his temperament and that of the normal
Englishman. The same remark applies to some
other famous Irish leaders. Wolfe Tone, for
instance, and Fitzgibbon (afterwards Lord Clare)
were unlike the usual type of Irishman&mdash;that is,
the Irishman in whom the Celtic element predominates;
but they were also unlike Englishmen.
The Anglo-Irish Protestants, a strong race
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
who have produced a number of remarkable men
in excess of the proportion they bear to the
whole population of the United Kingdom, fall
into two classes&mdash;the men of North-Eastern
Ulster, in whom there is so large an infusion
of Scottish blood that they may almost be called
&ldquo;Scotchmen with a difference,&rdquo; and the men
of Leinster and Munster, who are true Anglo-Celts.
It was to this latter class that Parnell
belonged. They are a group by themselves, in
whom some of the fire and impulsiveness of the
Celt has been blended with some of the firmness,
the tenacity, and the close hold upon facts which
belong to the Englishman. Mr. Parnell, however,
though he might be reckoned to the Anglo-Irish
type, was not a normal specimen of it. He
was a man whom you could not refer to any
category, peculiar both in his intellect and in his
character generally.</p>
<p>His intellect was eminently practical. He
did not love speculation or the pursuit of
abstract truth, nor had he a taste for literature,
still less a delight in learning for its own sake.
Even of the annals of Ireland his knowledge
was most slender. He had no grasp of constitutional
questions, and was not able to give any
help in the construction of a Home Rule scheme
in 1886. His general reading had been scanty,
and his speeches show no acquaintance either
with history, beyond the commonest facts, or with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
any other subject connected with politics. Very
rarely did they contain a maxim or reflection of
general applicability, apart from the particular
topic he was discussing. Nor did he ever
attempt to give to them the charm of literary
ornament. All was dry, direct, and practical,
without so much as a graceful phrase or a
choice epithet. Sometimes, when addressing a
great public meeting, he would seek to rouse the
audience by vehement language; but though there
might be a glow of suppressed passion, there were
no flashes of imaginative light. Yet he never
gave the impression of an uneducated man.
His language, though it lacked distinction, was
clear and grammatical. His taste was correct.
It was merely that he did not care for any of
those things which men of ability comparable to
his usually do care for. His only interests, outside
politics, lay in mechanics and engineering
and in the development of the material resources
of his country. He took pains to manage his
estate well, and was specially anxious to make
something out of his stone quarries, and to learn
what could be done in the way of finding and
working minerals.</p>
<p>Those who observed that he was almost
always occupied in examining and attacking the
measures or the conduct of those who governed
Ireland were apt to think his talent a purely
critical one. They were mistaken. Critical,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
indeed, it was, in a remarkable degree; keen,
penetrating, stringently dissective of the arguments
of an opponent, ingenious in taking advantage of
a false step in administration or of an admission
imprudently made in debate. But it had also a
positive and constructive quality. From time to
time he would drop his negative attitude and
sketch out plans of legislation which were always
consistent and weighty, though not made attractive
by any touch of imagination. They were the
schemes not so much of a statesman as of an able
man of business, who saw the facts, especially
the financial facts, in a sharp, cold light, and
they seldom went beyond what the facts could be
made to prove. And his ideas struck one as
being not only forcible but independent, the fruit
of his own musings. Although he freely used
the help of others in collecting facts or opinions,
he did not seem to be borrowing the ideas,
but rather to have looked at things for himself,
and seen them as they actually were, in
their true perspective, not (like many Irishmen)
through the mists of sentiment or party feeling.
The impression made by one of his more elaborate
speeches might be compared to that which
one receives from a grey sunless day with an east
wind, a day in which everything shows clear, but
also hard and cold.</p>
<p>To call his mind a narrow one, as people sometimes
did, was to wrong it. If the range of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
interests was limited, his intelligence was not.
Equal to any task it undertook, it judged soundly,
appreciating the whole phenomena of the case,
men and things that had no sort of attraction
for it. There was less pleasure in watching its
activities than the observation of a superior
mind generally affords, for it was always directed
to immediate aims, and it wanted the originality
which is fertile in ideas and analogies. It
was not discursive, not versatile, not apt to
generalise. It did not rejoice in the exercise of
thought for thought&rsquo;s sake, but felt itself to be
merely a useful instrument for performing the
definite practical work which the will required
of it.</p>
<p>If, however, the intellect of the man could
not be called interesting, his character had at
least this interest, that it gave one many
problems to solve, and could not easily be
covered by any formul&aelig;. An observer who
followed the old method of explaining every
man by ascribing to him a single ruling passion,
would have said that his ruling passion was
pride. The pride was so strong that it
almost extinguished vanity. Parnell did not
appear to seek occasions for display, frequently
neglecting those which other men would have
chosen, seldom seeming to be elated by the
applause of crowds, and treating the House of
Commons with equal coolness whether it cheered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
him or howled at him. He cared nothing for
any social compliments or attentions, rarely
accepted an invitation to dinner, dressed with
little care and often in clothes whose style and
colour seemed unworthy of his position. He
was believed to be haughty and distant to his
followers; and although he could occasionally
be kindly and even genial, scarcely any were
admitted to intimacy, and few of the ordinary
signs of familiarity could be observed between
him and them. Towards other persons he was
sufficiently polite but warily reserved, showing
no desire for the cultivation of friendship,
or, indeed, for any relations but those
of business. Of some ordinary social duties,
such as opening and answering letters, he was,
especially in later years, more neglectful than
good breeding permits; and men doubted
whether to ascribe this fault to indolence or to
a superb disregard of everybody but himself.
Such disregard he often showed in greater
matters, taking no notice of attacks made
upon him which he might have refuted, and
intimating to the English his indifference to
their praise or blame. On one remarkable
occasion, at the beginning of the session of
1883, he was denounced by Mr. W. E. Forster
in a long and bitter speech, which told powerfully
upon the House. Many instances were
given in which Irish members had palliated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
or failed to condemn criminal acts, and Parnell
was arraigned as the head and front of this line
of conduct, and thus virtually responsible for the
outrages that had occurred. The Irish leader,
who had listened in impassive silence, broken
only by one interjected contradiction, to this
fierce invective, did not rise to reply, and was
with difficulty induced by his followers to deliver
his defence on the following day. To the
astonishment of every one, that defence consisted
in a declaration, delivered in a cold,
careless, almost scornful way, that for all he
said or did in Ireland he held himself responsible
to his countrymen only, and did not in
the least regard what Englishmen thought of
him. It was an answer not of defence but of
defiance.</p>
<p>Even to his countrymen he could on occasion
be disdainful, expecting them to defer to his own
judgment of his own course. He would sometimes
remain away from Parliament for weeks
together, although important business might be
under consideration, perhaps would vanish altogether
from public ken. Yet this lordly attitude
and the air of mystery which surrounded him
did not seem to be studied with a view to effect.
They were due to his habit of thinking first
and chiefly of himself. If he desired to indulge
his inclinations, he indulged them. Some extremely
strong motive of passion or interest might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
interpose to restrain this desire and stimulate
him to an unwelcome exertion; but no respect
for the opinion of others, nor fear of censure
from his allies or friends, would be allowed to
do so.</p>
<p>This boundless self-confidence and independence
greatly contributed to his success as a leader.
His faith in his star inspired a conviction that
obstacles whose reality his judgment recognised
would ultimately yield to his will, and gave him in
moments of crisis an undismayed fortitude which
only once forsook him&mdash;in the panic which was
suddenly created by the Ph&oelig;nix Park murders of
May 1882. The confidence which he felt, or appeared
to feel, reacted upon his party, and became
a chief ground of their obedience to him and their
belief in his superior wisdom. His calmness, his
tenacity, his patience, his habit of listening quietly
to every one, but deciding for himself, were all
evidences of that resolute will which imposed
itself upon the Irish masses no less than upon
his Parliamentary following, and secured for him
a loyalty in which there was little or nothing of
personal affection.</p>
<p>In these several respects his overweening pride
was a source of strength. In another direction,
however, it proved a source of weakness. There
are men in whom the want of moral principle,
of noble emotions, or of a scrupulous conscience
and nice sense of honour, is partly replaced by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
deference to the opinion of their class or of the
world. Such men may hold through life a
tolerably upright course, neither from the love
of virtue nor because they are ambitious and
anxious to stand well with those whom they
aspire to influence or rule, but because, having
a sense of personal dignity, combined with a
perception of what pleases or offends mankind,
they are resolved to do nothing whereby
their good name can be tarnished or an opening
given to malicious tongues. But when pride
towers to such a height as to become a law to
itself, disregarding the judgment of others, it
may not only lead its possessor into an attitude
of defiance which the world resents, but may
make him stoop to acts of turpitude which discredit
his character. Mr. Parnell was certainly
not a scrupulous man. Without dwelling upon
the circumstances attending the divorce case
already referred to, or upon his betrayal of Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s confidences, and his reckless appeals
during the last year of his life to the most inflammable
elements in Ireland, there are facts
enough in his earlier career to show that he had
little regard for truth and little horror for crime.
A revolution may extenuate some sins, but even
in a revolution there are men (and sometimes
the strongest men) whose moral excellence shines
through the smoke of conflict and the mists of
detraction. In Mr. Parnell&rsquo;s nature the moral
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
element was imperfectly developed. He seemed
cynical and callous; and it was probably his
haughty self-reliance which prevented him from
sufficiently deferring to the ordinary moralities
of mankind. His pride, which ought to have
kept him free from the suspicion of dishonour,
made him feel himself dispensed from the usual
restraints. Whatever he did was right in his
own eyes, and no other eyes need be regarded.
Phenomena somewhat similar were observable in
Napoleon. But Napoleon, though he came of a
good family, was obviously not a gentleman in
the common sense of the term. Mr. Parnell
was a gentleman in that sense. He had the
bearing, the manners, the natural easy dignity
of a man of birth who has always moved in
good society. He rarely permitted any one to
take liberties with him, even the innocent liberties
of familiar intercourse. This made his
departures from what may be called the inner
and higher standard of gentlemanly conduct all
the more remarkable.</p>
<p>He has been accused of a want of physical
courage. He did no doubt after the Ph&oelig;nix
Park murders ask the authorities in England for
police protection, being, not unnaturally, in fear
for his life; and he habitually carried firearms.
He was at times in danger, and there was every
reason why he should be prepared to defend himself.
An anecdote was told of another member
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
of the House of Commons whose initials were the
same as his own, and who, taking what he supposed
to be his own overcoat from the peg on
which it hung in the cloakroom of the House,
was startled when he put his hand into the pocket
to feel in it the cold iron of a pistol. Moral
courage he showed in a high degree during
his whole public career, facing his antagonists
with an unshaken front, even when they were
most numerous and bitter. Though he intensely
disliked imprisonment, the terms on which he
came out of Kilmainham Gaol left no discredit
upon him. He behaved with perfect dignity
under the attacks of the press in 1887, and in
the face of the use made of letters attributed to
him which turned out to have been forged by
Richard Pigott&mdash;letters which the bulk of the
English upper classes had greedily swallowed.
With this courage and dignity there was, however,
little trace of magnanimity. He seldom said a
generous word, or showed himself responsive to
such a word spoken by another. Accustomed to
conceal his feelings, except in his most excited
moments, he rarely revealed, but he certainly
cherished, vindictive sentiments. He never forgave
either Mr. W. E. Forster or Mr. Gladstone
for having imprisoned him in 1881;<a name='FNanchor_0030' id='FNanchor_0030'></a><a href='#Footnote_0030' class='fnanchor'>[36]</a> and though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
he stood in some awe of the latter, whom he
considered the only really formidable antagonist
he had ever had to confront, he bore a grudge
which smouldered under the reconciliation of 1886
and leapt into flame in the manifesto of November
1890.</p>
<p>The union in Mr. Parnell of intense passion
with strenuous self-control struck all who watched
him closely, though it was seldom that passion
so far escaped as to make the contrast visibly
dramatic. Usually he was cold, grave, deliberate,
repelling advances with a sort of icy courtesy.
He hardly ever lost his temper in the House of
Commons, even in his last session under the
sarcasms of his former friends, though the low,
almost hissing tones of his voice sometimes
betrayed an internal struggle. But during the
electoral campaign in Kilkenny, in December
1890, when he was fighting for his life, he was
more than once so swept away by anger that
those beside him had to hold him back from
jumping off the platform into the crowd to strike
down some one who had interrupted him. Suspended
for a moment, his mastery of himself
quickly returned. Men were astonished to
observe how, after some of the stormy passages
at the meetings of Irish members held in one
of the House of Commons committee-rooms in
December 1890, he would address quietly, perhaps
lay his hand upon the shoulder of, some one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
of the colleagues who had just been denouncing
him, and on whom he had poured all the vitriol
of his fierce tongue. As this could not have
been good-nature, it must have been either
calculated policy or a pride that would not
accept an injury from those whom he had been
wont to deem his subjects. Spontaneous kindliness
was never ascribed to him; nor had he,
so far as could be known, a single intimate
friend.</p>
<p>Oratory is the usual avenue to leadership in a
democratic movement, and Mr. Parnell is one of
the very few who have arrived at power neither
by that road nor by military success. So far
from having by nature any of the gifts or graces
of a popular speaker, he was at first conspicuously
deficient in them, and became at last effective
only by constant practice, and by an intellectual
force which asserted itself through commonplaceness
of language and a monotonous delivery.
Fluency was wanting, and even moderate ease
was acquired only after four or five years&rsquo; practice.
His voice was neither powerful nor delicate in its
modulations, but it was clear, and the enunciation
deliberate and distinct, quiet when the matter
was ordinary, slow and emphatic when an important
point arrived. With very little action of the
body, there was often an interesting and obviously
unstudied display of facial expression. So far from
glittering with the florid rhetoric supposed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
characterise Irish eloquence, his speeches were
singularly plain, bare, and dry. Neither had
they any humour. If they ever raised a smile,
which seldom happened, it was by some touch of
sarcasm or adroit thrust at a point left unguarded
by an adversary. Their merit lay in their
lucidity, in their aptness to the matter in hand,
in the strong practical sense which ran through
them, coupled with the feeling that they came
from one who led a nation, and whose forecasts
had often fulfilled themselves. They were carefully
prepared, and usually made from pretty
full notes; but the preparation had been given
rather to the matter and the arrangement than to
the diction, which had rarely any ornament or
literary finish. Of late years he spoke infrequently,
whether from indolence or from weak
health, or because he thought little was to be
done in the face of a hostile majority, now that
the tactics of obstruction had been abandoned.
When he interposed without preparation in a
debate which had arisen unexpectedly, he was
short, pithy, and direct; indeed, nothing was
more characteristic of Parnell than his talent
for hitting the nail on the head, a talent which
always commands attention in deliberative assemblies.
No one saw more clearly or conveyed in
terser language the course which the circumstances
of the moment required; and as his mastery of
parliamentary procedure and practice came next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
to that of Mr. Gladstone, any advice that he
gave to the House on a point of order carried
weight. It would indeed be no exaggeration to
say that during the sessions of 1889 and 1890
he was distinctly the second man in the House
of Commons, surpassed in debating power by
five or six others, but inferior to Mr. Gladstone
alone in the interest which his speeches excited
and in the impression they produced. Along
with this access of influence his attitude and the
spirit of his policy appeared to rise and widen.
There was less of that hard attorneyism which
had marked his criticisms of the Tory Government
and their measures up to March 1880, and of the
Liberal Government and their measures during
the five following years. He seemed to grow
more and more to the full stature of a statesman,
with constructive views and a willingness to make
the best of the facts as he found them. Yet even
in this later and better time one note of greatness
was absent from his speeches. There was
nothing genial or generous or elevated about
them. They never soared into an atmosphere
of lofty feeling, worthy of the man who was by
this time deemed to be leading his nation to
victory, and who had begun to be admired and
honoured by one of the two great historic English
parties.</p>
<p>Parnell was not only versed in the rules of
parliamentary procedure, but also a consummate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
master of parliamentary tactics. Soon after he
entered the House of Commons he detected its
weak point, and perfected a system of obstruction
which so destroyed the efficiency of its time-honoured
modes of doing business that new sets
of rules, each more stringent than the preceding,
had to be devised between 1878 and 1888. The
skill with which he handled his small but well-disciplined
battalion was admirable. He was
strict with individuals, requiring absolute obedience
to the party rules, but ready to gratify any
prevailing current of feeling when he saw that
this could be done without harm to the cause.
More than once, when English members who
happened to be acting with him on some particular
question pressed him to keep his men quiet and
let a division be taken at once, he answered that
they were doubtless right in thinking that the
moment for securing a good division had arrived,
but that he must not muzzle his followers when
they wanted to have their fling. The best
proof of the tact with which he ruled a section
comprising many men of brilliant talents lies
in the fact that there was no serious revolt,
or movement towards revolt, against him until
the breach of 1890 between himself and the
Liberal party had led to the belief that his continued
leadership would mean defeat at the polls
in Great Britain, and the postponement, perhaps
for many years, of Home Rule for Ireland.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></div>
<p>Parnell&rsquo;s political views and tendencies were
eagerly canvassed by those who had studied
him closely. Many, among both Englishmen
and Irishmen, held that he was at heart a Conservative,
valuing strong government and attached
to the rights of property. They predicted that
if an Irish Parliament had been established, as
proposed by Mr. Gladstone in 1886, and an
Irish cabinet formed to administer the affairs of
the island, Parnell would have been the inevitable
and somewhat despotic leader of the
party of authority and order. His co-operation
with the agrarian agitators from 1879 onwards
was in this view merely a politic expedient to
gain support for the Home Rule campaign. For
this theory there is much to be said. Though
he came to lead a revolution, and was willing,
as appeared in the last few months of his life, to
appeal to the genuine revolutionary party, Parnell
was not by temper or conviction a revolutionist.
Those who were left in Ireland of the old Fenian
group, and especially that section of the extreme
Fenians out of which the secret insurrectionary
and dynamitard societies were formed, never
liked or trusted him. The passion which originally
carried him into public life was hatred of
England, and a wish to restore to Ireland, if
possible her national independence (though he
rarely if ever avowed this), or at least her
own Parliament. But he was no democratic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
leveller, and still less inclined to those socialistic
doctrines which the section influenced by Mr.
Davitt had espoused. He did not desire the
&ldquo;extinction of landlordism,&rdquo; and would probably
have been a restraining and moderating
force in an Irish legislature. That he was
genuinely attached to his native country need not
be doubted. But his patriotism had little of a
sentimental quality, and seemed to spring as
much from dislike of England as from love of
Ireland.</p>
<p>It may excite surprise that a man such as has
been sketched, with so cool a judgment and so
complete a self-control, a man (as his previous
career had shown) able to endure temporary
reverses in the confidence of ultimate success,
should have committed the fatal error, which
blasted his fame and shortened his life, of clinging
to the headship of his party when prudence
prescribed retirement. When he sought
the advice of Mr. Cecil Rhodes, retirement for
a time was the counsel he received. His
absence need not have been of long duration.
Had he, after the sentence of the Divorce
Court in November 1890, gone abroad for
eight or ten months, allowing some one to
be chosen in his place chairman of the Irish
party for the session, he might thereafter have
returned to the House of Commons, and would
doubtless, after a short lapse of time, have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
naturally recovered the leadership. No one else
could have resisted his claims. Unfortunately,
the self-reliant pride which had many a time
stood him in good stead, made him refuse to
bow to the storm. Probably he could not
understand the indignation which the proceedings
in the divorce case had awakened in
England, being morally somewhat callous, and
knowing that his offence had been no secret to
many persons in the House of Commons. He
had been accustomed to despise English opinion,
and had on former occasions suffered little
for doing so. He bitterly resented both Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s letter and the movement to depose
him which it roused in his own party. Having
often before found defiant resolution lead to
success, he determined again to rely on the
maxim which has beguiled so many to ruin, just
because it has so much truth in it&mdash;&ldquo;<i>De l&rsquo;audace,
encore de l&rsquo;audace, toujours de l&rsquo;audace.</i>&rdquo; The
affront to his pride disturbed the balance of his
mind, and made him feel as if even a temporary
humiliation would destroy the prestige that had
been won by his haughty self-confidence. It
was soon evident that he had overestimated his
power in Ireland, but when the schism began
there were many besides Lord Salisbury&mdash;many
in Ireland as well as in England&mdash;who predicted
triumph for him. Nor must it be thought that
it was pure selfishness which made him resolve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
rather to break with the English Liberals than
allow the Nationalist bark to be steered by any
hands but his own. He was a fatalist, and had
that confidence in his star and his mission which
is often characteristic of minds in which superstition&mdash;for
he was superstitious&mdash;and a certain
morbid taint may be discerned. There were
others who believed that no one but himself could
hold the Irish party together and carry the Irish
cause to triumph. No wonder that this belief
should have filled and perhaps disordered his
own brain.</p>
<p>The swiftness of his rise is a striking instance
of the power which intellectual concentration and a
strenuous will can exert, for he had no adventitious
help from wealth or family connection or from
the reputation of having suffered for his country.
<i>Ergo vivida vis animi pervicit.</i> When he entered
Parliament he was only thirty, with no experience
of affairs and no gift of speech; but the quality
that was in him of leading and ruling men, of
taking the initiative, of seeing and striking at the
weak point of the enemy, and fearlessly facing the
brunt of an enemy&rsquo;s attack, made itself felt in a
few months, and he rose without effort to the first
place. With some intellectual limitations and
some great faults, he will stand high in the long
and melancholy series of Irish leaders: less
lofty than Grattan, less romantic than Wolfe
Tone, less attractive than O&rsquo;Connell, less brilliant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
than any of these three, yet entitled to be
remembered as one of the most remarkable
characters that his country has produced in her
struggle of many centuries against the larger
isle.</p>

<h2>CARDINAL MANNING</h2>
</div>
<p>Henry Edward Manning, Archbishop of Westminster
and Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church,
was born in 1808, eight years after Cardinal
Newman, and died in 1892. He was one of the
most notable figures of his generation; and, indeed,
in a sense, an unique figure, for he contributed
a new type to the already rich and
various ecclesiastical life of England. If he
could scarcely be described as intellectually a man
of the first order, he held a considerable place
in the history of his time, having effected what
greater men might perhaps have failed to effect,
for the race is not always to the swift, and time
and chance favoured Manning.</p>
<p>He was the son of wealthy parents, his father
a City of London merchant; was educated at
Harrow and at Oxford, where he obtained high
classical honours and a Fellowship at Merton
College; was ordained a clergyman, and soon rose
to be Archdeacon of Chichester; and, having by
degrees been led further and further from his
original Low Church position into the Tractarian
movement, ultimately, at the age of forty-three,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
went over to the Church of Rome. Having
some time before lost his wife, he was at once
re-ordained a priest, was appointed Archbishop
of Westminster on Cardinal Wiseman&rsquo;s death in
1865, and raised to the Cardinalate by Pope
Pius IX. in 1875.</p>
<p>He was not a great thinker nor a man of
wide learning. His writings show no trace of
originality, nor indeed any conspicuous philosophical
acuteness or logical power. So far as
purely intellectual gifts are concerned, he was
not to be named with Cardinal Newman or with
several other of the ablest members of the
English Tractarian party, such as were the two
metaphysicians W. G. Ward and Dalgairns, both
of whom passed over to Rome, or such as was
Dean Church, an accomplished historian, and a
man of singularly beautiful character, who remained
an Anglican till his death in 1890. Nor,
though he had won a high reputation at his
University, was Manning a leading spirit in the
famous &ldquo;Oxford Movement.&rdquo; It was by his winning
manners, his graceful rhetoric, and his zealous
discharge of clerical duties, rather than by any
commanding talents that he rose to eminence in
the Church of England. Neither had his character
the same power either to attract or to awe as that
of Newman. Nobody in those days called him
great, as men called Newman. Nobody felt
compelled to follow where he led. There was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
not, either in his sermons or in his writings, or
in his bodily presence and conversation, anything
which could be pronounced majestic, or
lofty, or profound. In short, he was not in the
grand style, either as a man or as a preacher, and
wanted that note of ethereal purity or passionate
fervour which marks the two highest forms of
religious character.</p>
<p>Intelligent, however, skilful, versatile he was
in the highest degree; cultivated, too, with a
knowledge of all that a highly educated man
ought to know; dexterous rather than forcible
in theological controversy; an admirable rhetorician,
handling language with something of that
kind of art which Roman ecclesiastics most
cultivate, and in their possession of which the
leading Tractarians showed their affinity to
Rome, an exact precision of phrase and a subtle
delicacy of suggestion. Newman had it in the
fullest measure. Dean Church had it, with less
brilliance than Newman, but with no less grace and
dignity. Manning equalled neither of these, but
we catch in him the echo. He wrote abundantly
and on many subjects, always with cleverness
and with the air of one who claimed to belong
to the <i>&acirc;mes d&rsquo;&eacute;lite</i>, yet his style never attained
the higher kind of literary merit. There was no
imaginative richness about it, neither were there
the weight and penetration that come from sustained
and vigorous thinking. Similarly, with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
certain parade of references to history and to
out-of-the-way writers, he gave scant evidence of
solid learning. He was an accomplished disputant
in the sense of knowing thoroughly the more
obvious weaknesses of the Protestant (and especially
of the Anglican) position, and of being able
to contrast them effectively with the external
completeness and formal symmetry of the Roman
system. But he never struck out a new or
illuminative thought; and he seldom ventured
to face&mdash;one could indeed sometimes mark him
seeking to elude&mdash;a real difficulty.</p>
<p>What, then, was the secret of his great and
long-sustained reputation and influence? It lay
in his power of dealing with men. For the work
of an ecclesiastical ruler he had three inestimable
gifts&mdash;a resolute will, captivating manners, and a
tact equally acute and vigilant, by which he
seemed not only to read men&rsquo;s characters, but to
discern the most effective means of playing on
their motives. To call him an intriguer would be
unjust, because the word, if it does not imply the
pursuit of some mean or selfish object, does
generally connote a resort to unworthy arts; and
the Cardinal was neither dishonourable nor selfish.
But he had the talents which an intriguer needs,
though he used them in a spirit of absolute
devotion to the interests of his Church, and though
he was too much of a gentleman to think that
the interests of the Church, which might justify
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
a good deal, could be made to justify any and
every means. In conversation he had the art
of seeming to lay his mind alongside of yours,
wishful to know what you had to say, and
prepared to listen respectfully to it, even though
you might be much younger and of no personal
consequence. Yet you sometimes felt, if your
own power of observation had not been lulled to
sleep by the winning manner, that he was watching
you, and watching, in conformity to a settled
habit, the effect upon you of whatever he said. It
was hard not to be flattered by this air of kindly
deference, and natural to admire the great man
who condescended without condescension, even
though one might be secretly disappointed at the
want of freshness and insight in his conversation.
Like his famous contemporary, Bishop
Samuel Wilberforce, Manning was all things to
all men. He was possessed, no doubt, of far
less wit and far less natural eloquence than that
brilliant but variable creature. But he gave
a more distinct impression of earnest and unquestioning
loyalty to the cause he had made his
own.</p>
<p>In the government of his diocese, Manning
showed himself a finished ruler and manager of
men, flexible in his power of adapting himself to
any character or society, yet inflexible when firmness
was needed, usually tactful if not always
gentle in his methods, but tenacious in his purposes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
demanding rightfully from others the
simplicity of life and the untiring industry
of which he set an example himself. Over
women his influence was still greater than over
men, because women are more susceptible to
the charm of presence and address; nor could
any other ecclesiastic count so many conversions
among ladies of high station, his dignified carriage
and ascetic face according admirably with
his sacerdotal rank and his life of strict observance.
For some years it was his habit to go to
Rome early in Lent and remain till after Easter.
Promising subjects, who had doubts as to their
probabilities of salvation in the Anglican communion,
used to be invited to dinner to meet
him, and they fell in swift succession before his
skilful presentation of the peace and bliss to be
found within the Roman fold.</p>
<p>In his public appearances, it was neither
the solid substance of his discourses nor the
literary quality of their style that struck one, but
their judicious adaptation to the audience, and
the grace with which they were delivered. For
this reason&mdash;originality being rarer and therefore
more precious in the pulpit, where well-worn
themes have to be handled, than on a platform,
where the topic is one of the moment&mdash;his
addresses at public meetings were better than his
sermons, and won for him the reputation of a
speaker whom it was well worth while to secure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
at any social or philanthropic gathering. At the
Vatican &OElig;cumenical Council of 1870 it was less
by his speeches than by his work in private among
the assembled prelates that he served the Infallibilist
cause. Himself devoted, and, no doubt,
honestly devoted, to Ultramontane principles, he
did not hesitate to do violence to history and join
in destroying what freedom the Church at large
had retained, in order to exalt the Chair of Peter
to a position unheard of even at Trent, not to say
in the Middle Ages. His activity, his assiduity,
and his tireless powers of persuasion contributed
largely to the satisfaction at that Council
of the wishes of Pius IX., who presently rewarded
him with the Cardinalate. But the opponents of
the new dogma, who were as superior in learning
to the Infallibilists as they proved inferior in
numbers, carried back with them to Germany and
North America an undying distrust of the astute
Englishman who had shown more than a convert&rsquo;s
proverbial eagerness for rushing to extremes
and forcing others to follow. I remember to
have met some of the anti-Infallibilist prelates
returning to America in the autumn of 1870;
and in our many talks on shipboard they spoke of
the Archbishop in terms no more measured than
Nestorius may have used of St. Cyril after the
Council of Ephesus.</p>
<p>But Manning&rsquo;s powers shone forth most fully
in the course he gave to his policy as Archbishop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
of Westminster and head of the Roman
hierarchy in Britain. He had two difficulties
to confront. One was the suspicion of the
old English Roman Catholic families, who distrusted
him as a recent recruit from Protestantism,
a man brought up in ideas unfamiliar to their
conservative minds. The other was the aversion
of the ruling classes in England, and indeed of
Englishmen generally, to the pretensions of Rome
an aversion which, among the Tories, sprang
from deep-seated historical associations, and among
the Whigs drew further strength from dislike to
the reactionary tendencies of the Popedom on the
European continent, and especially its resistance
to the freedom and unity of Italy. In 1850
the creation by the Pope of a Roman Catholic
hierarchy in England, followed by Cardinal
Wiseman&rsquo;s letter dated from the Flaminian Gate,
had evoked a burst of anti-papal feeling which
never quite subsided during Wiseman&rsquo;s lifetime.
Both these enmities Manning overcame. The
old Catholic families rallied to a prelate who
supported with dignity and vigour the pretensions
of their church; while the suspicions of Protestants
were largely, if not universally, allayed
when they noted the attitude of a patriotic
Englishman, zealous for the greatness of his
country, which the Archbishop assumed, as well
as the heartiness with which he threw himself
into moral and philanthropic causes. Loyalty to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
Rome never betrayed him into any apparent
disloyalty to England. Too prudent to avow
sympathy with either political party, he seemed
less opposed to Liberalism than his predecessor
had been or than most of the English Catholics
were. While, of course, at issue with the Liberal
party upon educational questions, he was believed
to lean to Home Rule, and maintained good relations
with the Irish leaders. He joined those
who worked for the better protection of children
and the repression of vice, advocated total abstinence
by precept and example, and did much to
promote it among the poorer Roman Catholic
population. Discerning the growing magnitude
of what are called labour questions, he did not
recoil from proposals to limit by legislation the
hours of toil, and gladly exerted himself to settle
differences between employers and workmen,
showing his own sympathy with the needs and
hardships of the latter. Thus he won a popularity
with the London masses greater than any
prelate of the Established Church had enjoyed,
while the middle and upper classes noted with
pleasure that, however Ultramontane in his
theology, he always spoke and wrote as an
Englishman upon non-theological subjects.</p>
<p>In this there was no playing of a part, for he
sincerely cared about temperance, the welfare of
children, the advancement of the labouring class,
and the greatness of England. But there was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
also a sage perception of the incidental service
which his attitude in these matters could render
to his church; and he relished opportunities of
proving that a Catholic prelate could be not only
a philanthropist but also a patriot. He saw the
value of the attitude, though he used it honestly,
and if he was not artful, he was full of art.
Truth, for its own sake, he neither loved nor
sought, but, having once adopted certain conclusions,
doctrinal and practical, subordinated everything
else to them. Power he loved, yet not wholly
for the pleasure which he found in exerting it, but
also because he knew that he was fit to use it,
and could use it, to promote the aims he cherished.
To his church he was devoted heart and soul; nor
could any one have better served it so far as
England was concerned. No one in our time,
hardly even Cardinal Newman, has done so much
to sap and remove the old Protestant fears and
jealousies of Rome, fears and jealousies which
had descended from days when they were less
unreasonable than the liberality or indifference
of our times will allow. Truly the Roman
Church is a wonderful institution, fertile beyond
any other, since in each succeeding age she has
given birth to new types of force suited to the
conditions she has to deal with. In Manning she
developed a figure full of a kind of charm and
strength which could hardly have found due
scope within a Protestant body: a man who never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
obtruded a claim, yet never yielded one; who
was the loyal servant of a spiritual despotism,
yet apparently in sympathy with democratic ideas
and movements; equally welcome among the
poorest Irish of his diocese and at the gatherings
of the great; ready to join in every good work
with those most opposed to his own doctrines,
yet standing detached as the austere and unbending
representative of a world-embracing power.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Since these pages were written there has
appeared a Life of Cardinal Manning which, for
the variety and interest of its contents, and for the
flood of light which it throws upon its subject,
deserves to rank among the best biographies in
the English language. It reveals the inner life
of Manning, his high motives and his tortuous
methods, his piety and his aspirations, his occasional
lapses from sincerity and rectitude, with a
fulness to which one can scarcely find a parallel.
As was remarked by Mr. Gladstone, who was so
keenly interested in the book that for months he
could talk of little else, it leaves nothing for the
Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>It would be idle to deny that Manning&rsquo;s
reputation did in some measure suffer. Yet it
must in fairness be remembered that an ordeal
such as that to which he has been thus subjected
is seldom applied, and might, if similarly applied,
have lowered many another reputation. Cicero
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
has suffered in like manner. We should have
thought more highly of him, though I do not
know that we should have liked him better, if his
letters had not survived to reveal weaknesses
which other men, or their biographers, were discreet
enough to conceal.</p>
<p>I have not attempted to rewrite the preceding
pages in the light of Mr. Purcell&rsquo;s biography, for
to do so would have extended them beyond the
limits of a sketch. I have, moreover, found that
the disclosures contained in the biography do not
oblige me to darken the colours of the sketch
itself. Taken all in all, these intimate records of
Manning&rsquo;s life tend to confirm the view that, along
with his love of power and pre-eminence, along
with his carelessness about historic truth, along
with the questionable methods he sometimes
allowed himself to use, there lay deep in his heart
a genuine and unfailing sympathy with many
good causes, such as the cause of temperance,
and a real tenderness for the poor and for
children. If he was far removed from a saint,
still less was he the mere worldly ecclesiastic,
crafty and ambitious, who has in all ages been
a familiar and unlovely type of character.</p>

<h2>EDWARD AUGUSTUS FREEMAN<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor2">[37]</a></h2>
</div>
<p>Edward Freeman was born at Harborne in
South Staffordshire on 2nd August 1823, and
died at Alicante on 16th March 1892, in the
course of an arch&aelig;ological and historical journey
to the east and south of Spain, whither he had
gone to see the sites of the early Carthaginian
settlements. His life was comparatively uneventful,
as that of learned men in our time
usually is. He was educated at home and at a
private school till he went to Oxford at the age
of eighteen. There he was elected a scholar of
Trinity College in 1841, took his degree (second
class in <i>literae humaniores</i>) in 1845, and was
elected a fellow of Trinity shortly afterwards.
Marrying in 1847, he lost his fellowship, and
settled in 1848 in Gloucestershire, and at a later
time went to live in Monmouthshire, whence
he migrated in 1860 to Somerleaze, a pretty
spot about a mile and a half to the north-west
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
of Wells in Somerset. Here he lived
till 1884, when he was appointed (on the recommendation
of Mr. Gladstone) to the Regius
Professorship of Modern History at Oxford.
Thenceforth he spent the winter and spring in
the University, returning for the long vacation
to Somerleaze, a place he dearly loved, not only
in respect of the charm of the surrounding
scenery, but from its proximity to the beautiful
churches of Wells and to many places of historical
interest. For the greater part of his manhood
his surroundings were those of a country gentleman,
nor did he ever reconcile himself to town
life, for he loved the open sky, the fields and hills,
and all wild creatures, though he detested what
are called field sports, knew nothing of natural
history, and had neither taste nor talent for
farming. As he began life with an income sufficient
to make a gainful profession unnecessary,
he did not prepare himself for any, but gave free
scope from the first to his taste for study and
research. Thus the record of his life is, with the
exception of one or two incursions into the field
of practical politics, a record of his historical work
and of the journeys he undertook in connection
with it.</p>
<p>History was the joy as well as the labour of
his life. But the conception he took of it was
peculiar enough to deserve some remark. The
keynote of his character was the extraordinary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
warmth of his interest in the persons, things, and
places which he cared for, and the scarcely less
conspicuous indifference to matters which lay
outside the well-defined boundary line of his sympathies.
If any branch of inquiry seemed to him
directly connected with history, he threw himself
heartily into it, and drew from it all it could be
made to yield for his purpose. About other subjects
he would neither read nor talk, no matter
how completely they might for the time be filling
the minds of others. While an undergraduate,
and influenced, like most of the abler men among
his Oxford contemporaries, by the Tractarian
opinions and sentiments then in their full force
and freshness,<a name='FNanchor_0031' id='FNanchor_0031'></a><a href='#Footnote_0031' class='fnanchor'>[38]</a> he became interested in church
architecture, discerned the value which architecture
has as a handmaid to historical research, set
to work to study medi&aelig;val buildings, and soon
acquired a wonderfully full and exact knowledge
of the most remarkable churches and castles all
over England. He taught himself to sketch, not
artistically, but sufficiently well to record characteristic
points, and by the end of his life he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
accumulated a collection of hundreds of drawings
made by himself of notable buildings in France,
Germany, Italy, and Dalmatia, as well as in the
British Isles. Architecture was always thenceforward
to him the prime external record and
interpreter of history. But it was the only art in
which he took the slightest interest. He cared
nothing for pictures or statuary; was believed
to have once only, when his friend J. R. Green
dragged him thither, visited a picture-gallery in
the course of his numerous journeys; and did not
seem to perceive the significance which paintings
have as revealing the thoughts and social condition
of the time which produced them. Another
branch of inquiry cognate to history which he
prized was comparative philology. With no
great turn for the refinements of classical
scholarship, and indeed with some contempt for
the practice of Latin and Greek verse-making
which used to absorb much of the time and
labour of undergraduates and their tutors at
Oxford and Cambridge, he was extremely fond
of tracing words through different languages so
as to establish the relations of the peoples who
spoke them, and, indeed, used to argue that all
teaching of languages ought to begin with
Grimm&rsquo;s law, and to base his advocacy of the
retention of Greek as a <i>sine qua non</i> for an Arts
degree in the University on the importance of
that law. But with this love for philology as an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
instrument in the historian&rsquo;s hands, he took little
pleasure in languages simply as languages&mdash;that
is to say, he did not care to master, and was not
apt at mastering, the grammar and idioms of a
tongue. French was the only foreign language
he spoke with any approach to ease, though he
could read freely German, Italian, and modern
Greek, and on his tour in Greece made some
vigorous speeches to the people in their own
tongue. He had learnt to pronounce Greek in the
modern fashion, which few Englishmen can do;
but how much of his classically phrased discourses
did the crowds that acclaimed the distinguished
Philhellene understand? So too he was a keen
and well-trained arch&aelig;ologist, but only because
arch&aelig;ology was to him a priceless adjunct&mdash;one
might almost say the most trustworthy source&mdash;of
the study of early history. As evidence of
his accomplishments as an antiquary I cannot do
better than quote the words of a master of that
subject, who was also one of his oldest friends.
Mr. George T. Clark says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He was an accurate observer, not only of the broad
features of a country but of its ancient roads and earthworks,
its prehistoric monuments, and its earlier and especially its
ecclesiastical buildings. No man was better versed in the
distinctive styles of Christian architecture, or had a better
general knowledge of the earthworks from the study of which
he might hope to correct or corroborate any written records,
and by the aid of which he often infused life and reality into
otherwise obscure narrations.... He visited every spot upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
which the Conqueror is recorded to have set his foot, compared
many of the strongholds of his followers with those
they left behind them in Normandy, and studied the evidence
of Domesday for their character and possessions. When
writing upon Rufus he spent some time in examining the
afforested district of the New Forest, and sought for traces of
the villages and churches said to have been depopulated or
destroyed. And for us arch&aelig;ologists he did more than this.
When he attended a provincial congress and had listened to
the description of some local antiquity, some mound, or
divisional earthbank, or semi-Saxon church, he at once strove
to show the general evidence to be deduced from them, and
how it bore upon the boundaries or formation of some Celtic
or Saxon province or diocese, if not upon the general history
of the kingdom itself.... He thus did much to elevate the
pursuits of the arch&aelig;ologist, and to show the relation they
bore to the far superior labours of the historian.</p>
<p>Freeman was always at his best when in the field. It was
then that the full force of his personality came into play: his
sturdy upright figure, sharp-cut features, flowing beard, well-modulated
voice, clear enunciation, and fluent and incisive
speech. None who have heard him hold forth from the steps
of some churchyard cross, or from the top stone of some half-demolished
cromlech, can ever cease to have a vivid recollection
of both the orator and his theme.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Freeman took endless pains to master the topography
of any place he had to deal with. When
at work in his later years on Sicilian history he
visited, and he has minutely described, the site of
nearly every spot in that island where a battle
or a siege took place in ancient times, so that
his volumes have become an elaborate historical
guide-book for the student or tourist.</p>
<p>But while he thus delighted in whatever bore
upon history as he conceived it, his conception
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
was one which belonged to the eighteenth century
rather than to our own time. It was to him not
only primarily but almost exclusively a record
of political events&mdash;that is to say, of events in
the sphere of war, diplomacy, and government.
He expressed this view with concise vigour in
the well-known dictum, &ldquo;History is past politics,
and politics is present history&rdquo;; and though his
friends remonstrated with him against this view
as far too narrow, excluding from the sphere
of history many of its deepest sources of interest,
he would never give way. That historians
should care as much (or more) for the
religious or philosophical opinions of an age, or
for its ethical and social phenomena, or for the
study of its economic conditions, as for forms
of government or battles and sieges, seemed to
him strange. He did not argue against the
friends who differed from him, for he was ready
to believe that there must be something true and
valuable in the views of a man whom he respected;
but he could not be induced to devote
his own labours to the elucidation of these
matters. He would say to Green, &ldquo;You may
bring in all that social and religious kind of
thing, Johnny, but I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; So when he went
to deliver lectures in the United States, he delighted
in making new acquaintances there, and
was interested in the Federal system and in all
institutions which he could trace to their English
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
originals, but did not care to see anything or
hear anything about the economic development
or social life of the country.</p>
<p>The same predominant liking for the political
element in history made him indifferent to many
kinds of literature. It may indeed be said that
literature, simply as literature, did not attract
him. In his later years, at any rate, he seldom
read a book except for the sake of the political or
historical information it contained. Among the
writers whom he most disliked were Plato, Carlyle,
and Ruskin, in no one of whom could he see
any merit. Plato, he said, was the only author
he had ever thrown to the other end of the room.
Neither, although very fond of the Greek and
Roman classics generally, did he seem to enjoy
any of the Greek poets except Homer and Pindar
and, to some extent, Aristophanes. His liking
for Pindar used to surprise us, because Pindar is
peculiarly the favourite poet of poetical minds;
and I suspect it was not so much the splendour of
Pindar&rsquo;s style and the wealth of his imagination
that Freeman enjoyed, as rather the profusion of
historical and mythological references. He was
impatient with the Greek tragedians, and still
more impatient with Virgil, because (as he said)
&ldquo;Virgil cannot or will not say a thing simply.&rdquo;
Among English poets his preference was for
the old heroic ballads, such as the songs of
Brunanburh and Maldon, and, among recent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
writers, for Macaulay&rsquo;s <i>Lays</i>. The first thing
he ever published (1850) was a volume of verse,
consisting mainly of ballads, some of them very
spirited, on events in Greek and Moorish history.
It may be doubted if he remembered a line of
Shelley, Keats, Wordsworth, or Tennyson. He
blamed Walter Scott for misrepresenting history
in <i>Ivanhoe</i>, but constantly read the rest of his
stories, taking special pleasure in <i>Peveril of the
Peak</i>. He bestowed warm praise upon <i>Romola</i>,
on one occasion reading it through twice in a
single journey. Mrs. Gaskell&rsquo;s <i>Mary Barton</i>,
Marryatt&rsquo;s <i>Peter Simple</i>, Trollope&rsquo;s <i>The Warden</i>
and <i>Barchester Towers</i>, were amongst his
favourites. Among the moderns, Macaulay was
his favourite prose author, and he was wont to
say that from Macaulay he had learned never
to be afraid of using the same word to describe
the same thing, and that no one was a better
model to follow in the choice of pure English.
Limitations of taste are not uncommon among
eminent men. What was uncommon in Freeman
was the perfect frankness with which he
avowed his aversions, and the absence of any
pretence of caring for things which he did not
really care for. He was in this, as in all other
matters, a singularly simple and truthful man,
never seeking to appear different from what he
was, and finding it hard to understand why other
people should not be equally simple and direct.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
This directness made him express himself with
an absence of reserve which often gave offence.
Positive and definite, with a strong broad logic
which every one could follow, he was a formidable
controversialist even on subjects outside
history. A good specimen of his powers was
given in the argument against the cruelty of
field sports which he carried on with Anthony
Trollope. His cause was not a popular one in
England, but he stated it so well as to carry off
the honours of the fray.<a name='FNanchor_0032' id='FNanchor_0032'></a><a href='#Footnote_0032' class='fnanchor'>[39]</a></p>
<p>The restriction of his interest to a few topics&mdash;wide
ones, to be sure&mdash;seemed to increase the
intensity of his devotion to those few; and thus
even the two chief practical interests he had in
life connected themselves with his conception of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
history. One was the discharge of his duties as
a magistrate in the local government of his county.
While he lived at Somerleaze he rarely missed
Quarter Sessions, speaking seldom, but valuing
the opportunity of taking part in the rule of the
shire. The other was the politics of the time,
foreign politics even more than domestic. He
was from an early age a strong Liberal, throwing
himself into every question which bore on
the Constitution, either in state or in church, for
(as has been said) topics of the social or economic
kind lay rather out of his sphere. When Mr.
Gladstone launched his Irish Home Rule scheme
in 1886, Freeman espoused it warmly, and praised
it for the very point which drew most censure
even from Liberals, the removal of the Irish
members from Parliament. He was intensely
English and Teutonic, and wished the Gael to
be left to settle, or fight over, their own affairs in
their own island, as they had done eight centuries
ago. Even the idea of separating Ireland altogether
from the English Crown would not have
alarmed him, for he did not thank Strongbow
and Henry II. for having invaded it; while, on
the other hand, the plan of turning the United
Kingdom into a federation, giving to England,
Scotland, Ireland, and Wales each a local parliament
of its own, with an imperial parliament
for common concerns, shocked all his historical
instincts.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></div>
<p>In 1859 he was on the point of coming
forward as a parliamentary candidate for the
borough of Newport in Monmouthshire, and
again at the election of 1868 he actually did
stand for one of the divisions of Somerset, and
showed in his platform speeches a remarkable gift
of eloquence, and occasionally, also, of humour,
coupled with a want of those minor arts which
usually contribute more than eloquence does to
success in electioneering. I went round with
him, along with his and my friend Mr. Albert
Dicey, and few are the candidates who get so
much pleasure out of a contest as Freeman did.
He was a strenuous advocate of disestablishment
in Ireland, the question chiefly at issue in the
election of 1868, because he thought the Roman
Catholic Church was of right, and ought by law
to be, the national Church there; but no less
decidedly opposed to disestablishment in England,
where it would have pained him to see the uprooting
of a system entwined with the ideas and
events of the Middle Ages. In his later years
he told me that if the Liberal party took up the
policy of disestablishment in Wales, he did not
know whether he could adhere to them, much as
he desired to do so.</p>
<p>Similarly he disliked all schemes for drawing
the colonies into closer relations with the United
Kingdom, and even seemed to wish that they
should sever themselves from it, as the United
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
States had done. This view sprang partly from
his feeling that they were very recent acquisitions,
with which the old historic England had nothing
to do, partly also from the impression made
on him by the analogy of the Greek colonies.
He held that the precedent of the Greek
settlements showed the true and proper relation
between a &ldquo;metropolis,&rdquo; or mother-city, and her
colonies to be one not of political dependence or
interdependence, but of cordial friendliness and a
disposition to render help, nothing more. These
instances are worth citing because they illustrate
a remarkable difference between his way of looking
historically at institutions and Macaulay&rsquo;s way.
A friend of his (the late Mr. S. R. Gardiner),
like Freeman a distinguished historian, and like
him a strong Home Ruler, wrote to me upon this
point as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Freeman and Macaulay are alike in the high value they
set upon parliamentary institutions. On the other hand, when
Macaulay wants to make you understand a thing, he compares
it with that which existed in his own day. The standard
of the present is always with him. Freeman traces it to
its origin, and testifies to its growth. The strength of this
mode of proceeding in an historian is obvious. Its weakness
is that it does not help him to appreciate statesmanship
looking forward and trying to find a solution of difficult
problems. Freeman&rsquo;s attitude is that of the people who
cried out for the good laws of King Edward, trying to revive
the past.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Freeman was apt to go beyond his own
dictum about history and politics, for he sometimes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
made history present politics as well as
past.</p>
<p>By far the strongest political interest&mdash;indeed
it rose to a passion&mdash;of his later years was his
hatred of the Turk. In it his historical and
religious sentiment, for there was a good deal
of the Crusader about him, was blended with
his abhorrence of despotism and cruelty. Ever
since the beginning of the Crimean war he had
been opposed to the traditional English policy of
supporting the Sultan. Ever since he had thought
about foreign politics at all he had sympathised
with the Christians of the East. So when Lord
Beaconsfield seemed on the point of carrying the
country into a war with Russia in defence of the
Turks, no voice rose louder or bolder than his in
denouncing the policy then popular with the
upper classes in England. On this occasion he
gave substantial proof of his earnestness by
breaking off his connection with the <i>Saturday
Review</i> because it had espoused the Turkish
cause. This cost him &pound;600 a year, a sum
he could ill spare, and took from him what had
been the joy of his heart, opportunities of delivering
himself upon all sorts of current questions.
But his sense of duty forbade him to write for a
journal which was supporting a misguided policy
and a minister whom he thought unscrupulous.</p>
<p>His habit of speaking out his whole mind
with little regard to the effect his words might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
produce, or to the way in which they might
be twisted, sometimes landed him in difficulties.
One utterance raised an outcry at the time, because
it was made at a conference held in London
in December 1876 to oppose Lord Beaconsfield&rsquo;s
Eastern policy. The Duke of Westminster and
Lord Shaftesbury presided at the forenoon and
afternoon sessions, and the meeting, which told
powerfully on the country, was wound up by Mr.
Gladstone. Freeman&rsquo;s speech, only ten minutes
long, but an oratorical success at the moment, contained
the words, &ldquo;Perish the interests of England,
perish our dominion in India, rather than that we
should strike one blow or speak one word on behalf
of the wrong against the right.&rdquo; This flight
of rhetoric was perverted by his opponents into
&ldquo;Perish India&rdquo;; and though he indignantly
repudiated the misrepresentation, it continued to
be repeated against him for years thereafter, and
to be cited as an instance of the irresponsible
violence of the friends of the Eastern Christians.</p>
<p>The most conspicuous and characteristic merits
of Freeman as an historian may be summed up
in six points: love of truth, love of justice, industry,
common sense, breadth of view, and
power of vividly realising the political life of the
past.</p>
<p>Every one knows the maxim, <i>pectus facit
theologum</i>,<a name='FNanchor_0033' id='FNanchor_0033'></a><a href='#Footnote_0033' class='fnanchor'>[40]</a> a maxim accountable, by the way,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
for a good deal of weak theology. More truly
may it be said that the merits of a great historian
are far from lying wholly in his intellectual
powers. Among the highest of such merits,
merits which the professional student has even
more reason to appreciate than the general reader,
because he more frequently discerns the disturbing
causes, are two moral qualities. One is the zeal
for truth, with the willingness to undertake, in a
search for it, a toil by which no credit will ever
be gained. The other is a clear view of, and
loyal adherence to, the permanent moral standards.
In both these points Freeman stood in the front
rank. He was kindly and fair in his judgments,
and ready to make all the allowances for any
man&rsquo;s conduct which the conditions of his time
suggested, but he hated cruelty, falsehood, oppression,
whether in Syracuse twenty-four centuries
ago or in the Ottoman empire to-day. That
conscientious industry which spares no pains to
get as near as possible to the facts never failed
him. Though he talked less about facts and
verities than Carlyle did, Carlyle was not so
assiduous and so minutely careful in sifting every
statement before he admitted it into his pages.
That he was never betrayed by sentiment into
partisanship it would be too much to say.
Scottish critics have accused him, perhaps not
without justice, of being led by his English
patriotism to over-state the claims of the English
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
Crown to suzerainty over Scotland. J. R. Green,
as well as the late Mr. C. H. Pearson, thought
that the same cause disposed him to overlook
the weak points in the character of Harold son
of Godwin, one of his favourite heroes. But
there have been few writers who have so seldom
erred in this way; few who have striven so
earnestly to do full justice to every cause and
every person. Even the race prejudices which
he allowed himself to indulge, in letters and talk,
against Irishmen, Frenchmen, and Jews, scarcely
ever appear in his books. The characters he
has drawn of Lucius Cornelius Sulla, William
the Conqueror and William the Red, St. Thomas
of Canterbury (none of whom he liked), and, in
his <i>History of Sicily</i>, of Nicias, are models of the
fairness which historical portraiture requires. It
is especially interesting to compare his picture
of the unfortunate Athenian with the equally
vigorous but harsher view of Grote. Freeman,
whom many people thought fierce, was one of
the most soft-hearted of men, and tolerant of
everything but perfidy and cruelty. Though
disposed to be positive in his opinions, he was
always willing to reconsider a point when any
new evidence was discovered or any new argument
brought to his notice, and not unfrequently
modified his view in the light of such evidence
or arguments. It was this passion for accuracy
and for that lucidity of statement which is the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
necessary adjunct of real accuracy, that made him
deal so sternly with confused thinkers and careless
writers. Carelessness seemed to him a moral
fault, because a fault which true conscientiousness
excludes. So also clearness of conception and
exact precision in the use of words were so
natural to him, and appeared so essential to good
work, that he would set down the want of them
rather to indolence than to incapacity, and apply
to them a proportionately severe censure. Mere
ignorance he could pardon, but when it was, as
often happens, even in persons of considerable
pretensions, joined to presumption, his wrath was
the hotter because he deemed it a wholly righteous
wrath. Never touching any subject which he had
not mastered, he thought it his duty as a critic to
expose impostors, and rendered in this way, during
the years when he wrote for the <i>Saturday Review</i>,
services to English scholarship second only to
those which were embodied in his own treatises.
It must be confessed that he enjoyed the work,
and, like Samuel Johnson, was not displeased
to be told that he had &ldquo;tossed and gored several
persons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His determination to get to the bottom of a
question was the cause of the censure he so freely
bestowed both on lawyers, who were wont to
rest content with their technicalities, and not go
back to the historical basis on which those technicalities
rested, and on politicians who fell into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
the habit of using stock phrases which muddled
or misrepresented the principles involved. The
expression &ldquo;national property,&rdquo; as applied to
tithes, incensed him, and gave occasion for some
of his most vigorous writing. So the commonplace
grumblings against the presence of bishops
in the House of Lords, which may be heard from
people who acquiesce in the presence of hereditary
peers, led him to give the most clear and forcible
statement of the origin and character of that House
which our time has produced. Here he was on
ground he knew thoroughly. But his habits of
accuracy were not less fully illustrated by his attitude
towards branches of history he had not explored.
With a profound and minute knowledge
of English history down to the fourteenth century,
so far as his aversion to the employment of
manuscript authorities would allow, and a scarcely
inferior knowledge of foreign European history
during the same period, with a less full but very
sound knowledge down to the middle of the
sixteenth century, and with a thorough mastery
of pretty nearly all ancient history, his familiarity
with later European history, and with the history
of such outlying regions as India or America,
was not much beyond that of the average educated
man. He used to say when questioned on these
matters that &ldquo;he had not come down to that
yet.&rdquo; But when he had occasion to refer to those
periods or countries, he hardly ever made a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
mistake. If he did not know, he did not refer;
if he referred, he had seized, as if by instinct,
something which was really important and serviceable
for his purpose. The same remark applies
(speaking generally) to Gibbon and to Macaulay,
and I have heard Freeman make it of the writings
of Mr. Goldwin Smith, for whom he had a warm
admiration.</p>
<p>Freeman&rsquo;s abstention from the use of manuscript
sources was virtually prescribed by his
persistence in refusing to work out of his own
library, or, as he used to say, out of a room
which he could consider to be his library for the
time being. As, however, the original authorities
for the times with which he chiefly dealt
are, with few or unimportant exceptions, all in
print, this habit can hardly be considered a
defect in his historical qualifications. In handling
the sources he was a judicious critic and a
sound scholar, thoroughly at home in Greek and
Latin, and sufficiently equipped in Anglo-Saxon,
or, as he called it, Old English. Of his breadth
of view, of the command he had of the whole
sweep of his knowledge, of his delight in bringing
together things the most remote in place or time,
it is superfluous to speak. These merits are
perhaps most conspicuously seen in the plan of
his treatise on Federal Government, as well as
in the execution of that one volume which unfortunately
was all he produced of what might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
have been, if completed, a book of the utmost
value. But one or two trifling illustrations
of this habit of living in an atmosphere in
which the past was no less real to him than
the present may be forgiven. When careless
friends directed letters to him at &ldquo;Somerleaze,
Wookey, Somerset,&rdquo; Wookey being a village a
quarter of a mile from his house, but on the other
side of the river Axe, he would write back complaining
that they were &ldquo;confusing the England
and Wales of the seventh century.&rdquo; When his
attention had been called to a discussion in the
weekly journals about Shelley&rsquo;s first wife he wrote
to me, &ldquo;Why will they worry us with this
<i>Harrietfrage</i>? You and I have quite enough
to do with Helen, and Theodora, and Mary
Stuart.&rdquo; So in addressing Somersetshire rustics
during his election campaign in 1868, he could
not help on one occasion referring to Ptolemy
Euergetes, and on another launching out into an
eloquent description of the Landesgemeinde of
Uri.</p>
<p>Industry came naturally to Freeman, because
he was fond of his own studies and did not
think of his work as task work. The joy in
reading and writing about bygone times sprang
from the intensity with which he realised them.
He had no geographical imagination, finding
no more pleasure in books of travel than in
dramatic poetry. But he loved to dwell in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
past, and seemed to see and feel and make himself
a part of the events he described. Next
to their worth as statements of carefully investigated
facts, the chief merit of his books lies in
the sense of reality which fills them. The politics
of Corinth or Sicyon, the contest of William the
Red with St. Anselm, interested him as keenly
as a general election in which he was himself
a candidate. Looking upon current events with
an historian&rsquo;s eye, he was fond, on the other
hand, of illustrating features of Roman history
from incidents he had witnessed when taking part
in local government as a magistrate; and in
describing the relations of Hermocrates and
Athenagoras at Syracuse he drew upon observations
which he had made in watching the discussions
of the Hebdomadal Council at Oxford.
This power of realising the politics of ancient
or medi&aelig;val times was especially useful to him
as a writer, because without it his minuteness
might have verged on prolixity, seeing that he
cared exclusively for the political part of history.
It was one of the points in which he rose superior
to most of those German students with whom it
is natural to compare him. Many of them have
equalled him in industry and diligence; some have
surpassed him in the ingenuity which they bring
to bear upon obscure problems; but few of them
have shown the same gift for understanding
what the political life of remote times really was.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
Like Gibbon, Freeman was not a mere student,
but also a man with opportunities of mixing in
affairs, accustomed to bear his share in the world&rsquo;s
work, and so better able than the mere student
can be to comprehend how that work goes forward.
Though he was too peculiar in his views and his
way of stating them to have been adapted either
to the House of Commons or to a local assembly,
and would indeed have been wasted upon nineteen-twentieths
of the business there transacted,
he loved politics and watched them with a
shrewdly observant eye. Though he indulged
his foibles in some directions, he could turn upon
history a stream of clear common sense which
sometimes made short work of German conjectures.
And he was free from the craving to
have at all hazards something new to advance,
be it a trivial fact or an unsupported guess. He
was accustomed of late years to complain that
German scholarship seemed to be suffering from
the passion for <i>etwas Neues</i>, and the consequent
disposition to disparage work which did not
abound with novelties, however empty or transient
such novelties might be.</p>
<p>To think of the Germans is to think of
industry. Freeman was a true Teuton in the
mass of his production. Besides the seven thick
volumes devoted to the Norman Conquest and
William Rufus, the four thick volumes to Sicily,
four large volumes of collected essays, and nine or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
ten smaller volumes on architectural subjects, on
the English constitution, on the United States,
on the Slavs and the Turks, he wrote an even
greater quantity of matter which appeared in the
<i>Saturday Review</i> during the twenty years from
1856 to 1876, and it was by these articles, not
less than by his books, that he succeeded in
dispelling many current errors and confusions,
and in establishing some of his own doctrines
so firmly that we now scarcely remember what
iteration and reiteration, in season and out of
season, and much to the impatience of those
who remembered that they had heard these
doctrines often before, were needed to make them
accepted by the public. Freeman&rsquo;s swift facility
was due to his power of concentration. He
always knew what he meant an article to contain
before he sat down to his desk; and in his
historical researches he made each step so certain
that he seldom required to reinvestigate a point
or to change, in revising for the press, the substance
of what he had written.</p>
<p>In his literary habits he was so methodical
and precise that he could carry on three undertakings
at the same time, keeping on different
tables in his working rooms the books he needed
for each, and passing at stated hours from one
to the other. It is often remarked that the
growth of journalism, forcing men to write
hastily and profusely, tends to injure literature
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
both in matter and in manner. In point of
matter, Freeman, though for the best part of
his life a very prolific journalist, did not seem
to suffer. He was as exact, clear, and thorough
at the end as he had been at the beginning.
On his style, however, the results were unfortunate.
It retained its force and its point,
but it became diffuse, not that each particular
sentence was weak, or vague, or wordy, but that
what was substantially the same idea was
apt to be reiterated, with slight differences of
phrase, in several successive sentences or paragraphs.
He was fond of the Psalter, great part
of which he knew by heart, and we told him
that he had caught too much of the manner of
Psalm cxix. This tendency to repetition caused
some of his books, and particularly the <i>Norman
Conquest</i> and <i>William Rufus</i>, to swell to a portentous
bulk. Those treatises, which constitute
a history of England from <span class='smcaplc'>A.D.</span> 1042 to 1100,
would be more widely read if they had been,
as they ought to have been, reduced to three or
four volumes; and as he came to perceive this,
he resolved in the last year of his life to
republish the <i>Norman Conquest</i> in a condensed
form. To be obliged to compress was a wholesome,
though unwelcome, discipline, and the
result is seen in some of his smaller books, such
as the historical essays, and the sketches of
English towns, often wonderfully fresh and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
vigorous bits of work. Anxiety to be scrupulously
accurate runs into prolixity, and Freeman
so loved his subjects that it pained him
to omit any characteristic detail a chronicler
had preserved; as he once observed to a distinguished
writer who was dealing with a much
later period, &ldquo;You know so much about your
people that you have to leave out a great deal,
I know so little that I must tell all I know.&rdquo;
The tendency to repeat the same word too frequently
sprang from his preference for words of
Teutonic origin and his pride in what he
deemed the purity of his English. His pages
would have been livelier had he felt free to
indulge in the humour with which his private
letters sparkled; for he was full of fun, though it
often turned on points too recondite for the public.
But it was only in the notes to his histories, and
seldom even there, that he gave play to one of
the merits that most commended him to his
friends.</p>
<p>So far of his books. He was, however, also
Regius Professor of History at Oxford during
the last eight years of his life, and thus the head
of the historical faculty in his own university
which he dearly loved. That he was less
effective as a teacher than as a writer may be
partly ascribed to his having come too late to
a new kind of work, and one which demands
the freshness of youth; partly also to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
cramping conditions under which professors
have to teach at Oxford, where everything is
governed by a system of examinations which
Freeman was never tired of denouncing as
ruinous to study. His friends, however, doubted
whether the natural bent of his mind was
towards oral teaching. It was a peculiar
mind, which ran in a deep channel of its
own, and could not easily, if the metaphor
be permissible, be drawn off to irrigate the
adjoining fields. He was always better at
putting his own views in a clear and telling
way than at laying his intellect alongside of
yours, apprehending your point of view, and
setting himself to meet it. Or, to put the same
thing differently, you learned more by listening
to him than by conversing with him. He
had not the quick intellectual sympathy and
effusion which feels its way to the heart of an
audience, and indeed derives inspiration from the
sight of an audience. In his election meetings
I noticed that the temper and sentiment of the
listeners did not in the least affect him; what
he said was what he himself cared to say, not
what he felt they would wish to hear. So
also in his lecturing he pleased himself, and
chose the topics he liked best rather than those
which the examination scheme prescribed to the
students. Perhaps he was right, for he was of those
whose excellence in performance depends upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
the enjoyment they find in the exercise of their
powers. But even on the topics he selected, he
did not take hold of and guide the mind of the
students, realising their particular difficulties and
needs, but simply delivered his own message in
his own way. Admitting this deficiency, the fact
remains that he was not only an ornament to the
University by the example he set of unflagging
zeal, conscientious industry, loyalty to truth, and
love of freedom, but also a stimulating influence
upon those who were occupied with history.
He delighted to surround himself with the most
studious of the younger workers, gave them
abundant encouragement and recognition, and
never grudged the time to help them by his
knowledge or his counsel.</p>
<p>Much the same might be said of his lifelong
friend and illustrious predecessor in the chair of
history (Dr. Stubbs), whom Freeman had been
generously extolling for many years before the
merits of that admirable scholar became known to
the public. Stubbs disliked lecturing; and though
once a year he delivered a &ldquo;public lecture&rdquo; full of
wisdom, and sometimes full of wit also, he was not
effective as a teacher, not so effective, for instance,
as Bishop Creighton, who won his reputation
at Merton College long before he became Professor
of Ecclesiastical History at Cambridge.
But Stubbs, by his mere presence in the University,
and by the inexhaustible kindness with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
which he answered questions and gave advice,
rendered great services to the studies of the place.
It may be doubted whether, when he was raised
to the episcopal bench, history did not lose more
than the Church of England gained. Other men
of far less ability could have discharged five-sixths
of a bishop&rsquo;s duties equally well, but there was no
one else in England, if indeed in Europe, capable
of carrying on his historical researches. So
Dr. Lightfoot was, as Professor at Cambridge,
doing work for Christian learning even more
precious than the work which is still affectionately
remembered in his diocese of Durham.</p>
<p>Few men have had a genius for friendship
equal to Freeman&rsquo;s. The names of those he
cared for were continually on his lips, and their
lives in his thoughts; their misfortunes touched
him like his own; he was always ready to
defend them, always ready to give any aid they
needed. No differences of opinion affected his
regard. Sensitive as he was to criticism, he
received their censure on any part of his work
without offence. The need he felt for knowing
how they fared and for sharing his thoughts with
them expressed itself in the enormous correspondence,
not of business, but of pure affection, which
he kept up with his many friends, and which
forms, for his letters were so racy that many of
them were preserved, the fullest record of his
life.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></div>
<p>This warmth of feeling deserves to be dwelt
on, because it explains the tendency to vehemence
in controversy which brought some enmities
upon him. There was an odd contrast between
his fondness for describing wars and battles and
that extreme aversion to militarism which made
him appear to dislike the very existence of a
British army and navy. So his combativeness,
and the zest with which he bestowed shrewd
blows on those who encountered him, though
due to his wholesome scorn for pretenders, and
his hatred of falsehood and injustice, seemed
inconsistent with the real kindliness of his nature.
The kindliness, however, no one who knew him
could doubt; it showed itself not only in his
care for dumb creatures and for children, but in
the depth and tenderness of his affections. Of
religion he spoke little, and only to his most
intimate friends. In opinion he had drifted a
long way from the Anglo-Catholic position of
his early manhood; but he remained a sincerely
pious Christian.</p>
<p>Though his health had been infirm for some
years before his death, his literary activity did
not slacken, nor did his powers show signs of
decline. There is nothing in his writings, nor
in any writings of our time, more broad, clear,
and forcible than many chapters of the <i>History
of Sicily</i>. Much of his work has effected its
purpose, and will, by degrees, lose its place in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
the public eye. But much will live on into a
yet distant future, because it has been done so
thoroughly, and contains so much sound and
vigorous thinking, that coming generations of
historical students will need it and value it almost
as our own has done.</p>

<h2>ROBERT LOWE VISCOUNT SHERBROOKE<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor2">[41]</a></h2>
</div>
<p>Had Robert Lowe died in 1868, when he became
a Cabinet Minister, his death would have been a
political event of the first magnitude; but when
he died in 1892 (in his eighty-second year) hardly
anybody under forty years of age knew who Lord
Sherbrooke was, and the new generation wondered
why their seniors should feel any interest in the
disappearance of a superannuated peer whose
name had long since ceased to be heard in either
the literary or the political world. It requires
an effort to believe that he was at one time held
the equal in oratory and the superior in intellect
of Mr. Bright and Mr. Gladstone. There are few
instances in our annals of men who have been
equally famous and whose fame has been bounded
by so short a span out of a long life.</p>
<p>No one who knew Lowe ever doubted his
abilities. He made a brilliant reputation, first at
Winchester (where, as his autobiography tells us,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
he was miserable) and then at Oxford, where he was
the contemporary and fully the peer of Roundell
Palmer (afterwards Lord Chancellor Selborne)
and of Archibald Tait (afterwards Archbishop of
Canterbury). He was much sought after and
wonderfully effective as a private tutor or &ldquo;coach&rdquo;
in classical subjects, being not only an excellent
scholar but extremely clear and stimulating as a
teacher. He retained his love of literature all
through life, and made himself, <i>inter alia permulta</i>,
a good Icelandic scholar and a fair Sanskrit
scholar. For mathematics he had no turn at all.
Active sports, he tells us, he enjoyed, characteristically
adding, &ldquo;they open to dulness also its road
to fame.&rdquo; When he left the University, where
anecdotes of his caustic wit were long current, he
tried his fortune at the Bar, but with such scant
success that he presently emigrated to New
South Wales, soon rose to prominence and unpopularity
there, returned in ten years with a
tolerable fortune and a detestation of democracy,
became a leading-article writer on the <i>Times</i>,
entered Parliament, but was little heard of till
Lord Palmerston gave him (in 1859) the place of
Vice-President of the Committee of Council on
Education. His function in that office was to
administer the grants made from the national
treasury to elementary schools, and as he found
the methods of inspection rather lax, and noted a
tendency to superficiality and a neglect of backward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
children, he introduced new rules for the
distribution of the grant (the so-called &ldquo;Revised
Code&rdquo;) which provoked violent opposition. The
motive was good, but the rules were too mechanical
and rigid and often worked harshly; so he
was presently driven from office by an attack led
by Lord Robert Cecil (now Lord Salisbury).</p>
<p>Though Lowe became known by this struggle,
his conspicuous fame dates from 1865, when he
appeared as the trenchant critic of a measure for
extending the parliamentary franchise in boroughs,
introduced by a private member. Next year
his powers shone forth in their full lustre. The
Liberal Ministry of Lord Russell, led in the
House of Commons by Mr. Gladstone, had
brought in a Franchise Extension Bill (applying
to boroughs only) which excited the dislike
of the more conservative or more timid among
their supporters. This dislike might not have gone
beyond many mutterings and a few desertions
but for the vehemence with which Lowe opposed
the measure. He fought against it in a series of
speeches which produced a greater impression in
the House of Commons, and roused stronger
feelings of admiration and hostility in the
country, than any political addresses had done
since 1832. The new luminary rose so suddenly
to the zenith, and cast so unexpected a
light that everybody was dazzled; and though
many dissented, and some attacked him bitterly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
few ventured to meet him in argument on the
ground he had selected. The effect of these
speeches of 1866 can hardly be understood by
any one who reads them to-day unless he knows
how commonplace and &ldquo;practical,&rdquo; that is to
say, averse to general reasonings and historical
illustrations, the character of parliamentary debating
was becoming even in Lowe&rsquo;s time. It
is still more practical and still less ornate in our
own day.</p>
<p>The House of Commons then contained,
and has indeed usually contained (though some
Houses are much better than others), many capable
lawyers, capable men of business, capable
country gentlemen; many men able to express
themselves with clearness, fluency, and that sort
of temperate good sense which Englishmen
especially value. Few, however, were able to
produce finished rhetoric; still fewer had a range
of thought and knowledge extending much beyond
the ordinary education of a gentleman and
the ordinary ideas of a politician; and the assembly
was one so intolerant of rhetoric, and so much inclined
to treat, as unpractical, facts and arguments
drawn from recondite sources, that even those who
possessed out-of-the-way learning were disposed,
and rightly so, to use it sparingly. In Robert
Lowe, however, a remarkable rhetorical and dialectical
power was combined with a command
of branches of historical, literary, and economic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
knowledge so unfamiliar to the average member
as to have for him all the charm of novelty.
The rhetoric was sometimes too elaborate. The
political philosophy was not always sound. But
the rhetoric was so polished that none could fail
to enjoy it; and the political philosophy was put
in so terse, bright, and pointed a form that it
made the ordinary country gentleman fancy himself
a philosopher while he listened to it in the
House or repeated it to his friends at the club.
The speeches, which, though directed against
a particular measure, constituted an indictment
of democratic government in general, had the
advantages of expressing what many felt but
few had ventured to say, and of being delivered
from one side of the House and cheered by
the other side. No position gives a debater in
the House of Commons such a vantage ground
for securing attention. Its rarity makes it remarkable.
If the speaker who attacks his own
party is supposed to do so from personal motives,
the personal element gives piquancy. If he may
be credited with conscientious conviction, his
shafts strike with added weight, for how strong
must conviction be when it turns a man against
his former friends. Accordingly, nothing so
much annoys a party and gratifies its antagonists
as when one of its own recalcitrant
members attacks it in flank. When one looks
back now at the contents of these speeches&mdash;there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
were only five or six of them&mdash;and finds
one&rsquo;s self surprised at their success, this favouring
circumstance and the whole temper of the
so-called &ldquo;upper classes&rdquo; need to be remembered.
The bulk of the wealthier commercial
class and a large section of the landed class had
theretofore belonged to the Liberal party. Most
of them, however, were then already beginning
to pass through what was called Whiggism into
habits of thought that were practically Tory.
They did not know how far they had gone till
Lowe&rsquo;s speeches told them, and they welcomed
his ideas as justifying their own tendencies.</p>
<p>In themselves, as pieces either of rhetoric or
of &ldquo;civil wisdom,&rdquo; the speeches are not first-rate.
No one would dream of comparing them to
Burke&rsquo;s, in originality, or in richness of diction,
or in weight of thought. But for the moment
they were far more appreciated than Burke&rsquo;s
were by the House of his time, which thought of
dining while he thought of convincing. Robert
Lowe was for some months the idol of a large
part of the educated class, and indeed of that
part chiefly which plumed itself upon its culture.
I recollect to have been in those days at a
breakfast party given by an eminent politician
and nominal supporter of the Liberal Ministry,
and to have heard Mr. G. S. Venables, the leader
of the <i>Saturday Review</i> set, an able and copious
writer who was a sort of literary and political
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
oracle among his friends, deliver, amid general
applause, including that of the host, the opinion
that Lowe was an intellectual giant compared to
Mr. Gladstone, and that the reputation of the
latter had been extinguished for ever.</p>
<p>This period of glory, which was enhanced by
the fall of Lord Russell and Mr. Gladstone from
power in June 1866&mdash;the defeat came on a minor
point, but was largely due to Lowe&rsquo;s speeches&mdash;lasted
till Lowe, who had now become a force to
be counted with, obtained office as Chancellor of
the Exchequer in the Liberal Ministry which
Mr. Gladstone formed in the end of 1868. From
that moment his position declined. He lost popularity
and influence both with the country and in
the House of Commons. His speeches were
always able, but they did not seem to tell when
delivered from the ministerial bench. His financial
proposals, though ingenious, were thought
too ingenious, and showed a deficient perception
of the tendencies of the English mind. No
section likes being taxed, but Lowe&rsquo;s budgets
met with a more than usually angry opposition.
His economies and retrenchments, so far from
bringing him the credit he deserved, exposed
him to the charge of cheese-paring parsimony,
and did much to render the Ministry unpopular.
Before that ministry fell in 1874, Lowe, who
had in 1873 exchanged the Exchequer for the
Home Office, had almost ceased to be a personage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
in politics. He did nothing to retrieve his fame
during the six years of Opposition that followed,
seldom spoke, took little part in the denunciation
of Lord Beaconsfield&rsquo;s Eastern and Afghan policy,
which went on from 1876 till 1880, and once at
least gave slight signs of declining mental power.
So in 1880 he was relegated to the House of
Lords, because the new Liberal Government of
that year could not make room for him. Very
soon thereafter his memory began to fail, and for
the last ten years of his life he had been practically
forgotten, though sometimes seen, a pathetic
figure, at evening parties. There is hardly a
parallel in our parliamentary annals to so complete
an eclipse of so brilliant a luminary.</p>
<p>This rapid obscuration of a reputation which
was genuine, for Lowe&rsquo;s powers had been amply
proved, was due to no accident, and was apparent
long before mental decay set in. The causes lay
in himself. One cause was purely physical. He
was excessively short-sighted, so much so that
when he was writing a letter, his nose was apt to
rub out the words his pen had traced; and this
defect shut him out from all that knowledge of
individual men and of audiences which is to be
obtained by watching their faces. Mr. Gladstone,
who never seemed to resent Lowe&rsquo;s attacks, and
greatly admired his gifts&mdash;it was not so clear
that Lowe reciprocated the admiration&mdash;used to
relate that on one occasion when a foreign potentate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
met the Minister in St. James&rsquo;s Park and put
out his hand in friendly greeting, Lowe repelled
his advances, and when the King said, &ldquo;But, Mr.
Lowe, you know me quite well,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;Yes, indeed, I know you far too well, and I don&rsquo;t
want to have anything more to do with you.&rdquo;
He had mistaken the monarch for a prominent
politician with whom he had had a sharp encounter
on a deputation a few days before! For
social purposes Lowe might almost as well have
been blind; yet he did not receive that kind of
indulgence which is extended to the blind. In
the interesting fragment of autobiography which
he left, he attributes his unpopularity entirely to
this cause, declaring that he was really of a kindly
nature, liking his fellow-men just as well as most
of them like one another.<a name='FNanchor_0034' id='FNanchor_0034'></a><a href='#Footnote_0034' class='fnanchor'>[42]</a> But in truth his own
character had something to answer for. Without
being ill-natured, he was deemed a hard-natured
man, who did not appear to consider the feelings
of others. He had indeed a love of mischief,
and gleefully tells in his autobiography how,
when travelling in his youth through the Scottish
Highlands, he drove the too self-conscious Wordsworth
wild by his incessant praise of Walter Scott.<a name='FNanchor_0035' id='FNanchor_0035'></a><a href='#Footnote_0035' class='fnanchor'>[43]</a>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
He had not in political life more than his fair
share of personal enmities. One of them was
Disraeli&rsquo;s. They were not unequally matched.
Lowe was intellectually in some respects stronger,
but he wanted Disraeli&rsquo;s skill in managing men
and assemblies. Disraeli resented Lowe&rsquo;s sarcasms,
and on one occasion, when the latter had
made an indiscreet speech, went out of his way
to inflict on him a personal humiliation.</p>
<p>Nor was this Lowe&rsquo;s only defect. Powerful
in attack, he was feeble in defence. Terrible as
a critic, he had, as his official career showed, little
constructive talent, little tact in shaping or recommending
his measures. Unsteady or inconstant
in purpose, he was at one moment headstrong,
at another timid or vacillating. These faults,
scarcely noticed when he was in Opposition,
sensibly reduced his value as a minister and as a
Cabinet colleague.</p>
<p>In private Lowe was good company, bright,
alert, and not unkindly. He certainly did not,
as was alleged of another famous contemporary,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
Lord Westbury, positively enjoy the giving of
pain. But he had a most unchristian scorn for the
slow and the dull and the unenlightened, and never
restrained his scorching wit merely for the sake of
sparing those who came in his way. If the distinction
be permissible, he was not cruel but he
was merciless, that is to say, unrestrained by compassion.
Instances are not wanting of men who
have maintained great influence in spite of their
rough tongues and the enmities which rough
tongues provoke. But such men have usually
also possessed some of the arts of popularity, and
have been able to retain the adherence of their
party at large, even when they had alienated
many who came into personal contact with them.
This was not Lowe&rsquo;s case. He did not conceal
his contempt for the multitude, and had not the
tact needed for humouring it, any more than for
managing the House of Commons. The very
force and keenness of his intellect kept him aloof
from other people and prevented him from understanding
their sentiments. He saw things so
clearly that he could not tolerate mental confusion,
and was apt to reach conclusions so fast
that he missed perceiving some of the things
which are gradually borne in upon slower minds.
There are also instances of strong men who,
though they do not revile their opponents, incur
hatred because their strength and activity make
them feared. Hostility concentrates itself on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
opponents deemed most formidable, and a political
leader who is spared while his fellows are attacked
cannot safely assume that this immunity is a
tribute to his virtues. Incessant abuse fell to
the lot of Mr. Bright, who was not often, and of
Mr. Gladstone, who was hardly ever, personally
bitter in invective. But in compensation Mr.
Bright and Mr. Gladstone received enthusiastic
loyalty from their followers. For Lowe there was
no such compensation. Even his own side did
not love him. There was also a certain harshness,
perhaps a certain narrowness, about his views.
Even in those days of rigid economics, he took
an exceptionally rigid view of all economic problems,
refusing to make allowance for any motives
except those of bare self-interest. Though he
did not belong by education or by social
ties to the Utilitarian group, and gave an ungracious
reception to J. S. Mill&rsquo;s first speeches
in the House of Commons, he was a far more
stringent and consistent exponent of the harder
kind of Benthamism than was Mill himself. He
professed, and doubtless to some extent felt, a
contempt for appeals to historical or literary
sentiment, and relished nothing more than deriding
his own classical training as belonging to an
effete and absurd scheme of education. He left
his mark on our elementary school system by
establishing the system of payment by results,
but nearly every change made in that system
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
since his day has tended to destroy the alterations
he made and to bring back the older condition
of things, though no doubt in an amended form.
His ideas of University reform were crude and
barren, limited, indeed, to the substitution of what
the Germans call &ldquo;bread studies&rdquo; for mental cultivation,
and to the extension of the plan of competitive
examinations for honours and money
prizes, a plan which more and more displeases
the most enlightened University teachers, and
is felt to have done more harm than good to
Oxford and Cambridge, where it has had the
fullest play. He had also, and could give good
reasons for his opinion, a hearty dislike to endowments
of all kinds; and once, when asked
by a Royal Commission to suggest a mode of
improving their application, answered in his
trenchant way, &ldquo;Get rid of them. Throw them
into the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would not be fair to blame Lowe for the
results which followed his vigorous action against
the extension of the suffrage in 1866, for no one
could then have predicted that in the following
year the Tories, beguiled by Mr. Disraeli, would
reverse their former attitude and carry a suffrage
bill far wider than that which they had rejected a
year before. But the sequel of the successful
resistance of 1866 may stand as a warning to
those who think that the course of thoroughgoing
opposition to a measure they dislike is, because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
it seems courageous, likely to be the right and
wise course for patriotic men. Had the moderate
bill of 1866 been suffered to pass, the question of
further extending the suffrage might possibly have
slept for another thirty years, for there was no
very general or urgent cry for it among the working
people, and England would have continued
to be ruled in the main by voters belonging to
the middle class and the upper section of the
working class. The consequence of the heated
contest of 1866 was not only to bring about
a larger immediate change in 1867, but to
create an interest in the question which soon
prompted the demand for the extension of household
suffrage to the counties, and completed in
1884-85 the process by which England has become
virtually a democracy, though a plutocratic
democracy, still affected by the habits and notions
of oligarchic days. Thus Robert Lowe, as much
as Disraeli and Gladstone, may in a sense be
called an author of the tremendous change which
has passed upon the British Constitution since
1866, and the extent of which was not for a
long while realised. Lowe himself never recanted
his views, but never repeated his declaration
of them, feeling that he had incurred
unpopularity enough, and probably feeling also
that the case was hopeless.</p>
<p>People who disliked his lugubrious forecasts
used to call him a Cassandra, perhaps forgetting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
that, besides the distinctive feature of Cassandra&rsquo;s
prophecies that nobody believed them, there was
another distinctive feature, viz. that they came
true. Did Lowe&rsquo;s? It is often profitable and
sometimes amusing to turn back to the predictions
through which eminent men relieved their
perturbed souls, and see how far these superior
minds were able to discern the tendencies, already
at work in their time, which were beginning to
gain strength, and were destined to determine
the future. Whoever reads Lowe&rsquo;s speeches of
1865-67 may do worse than glance at the same
time at a book,<a name='FNanchor_0036' id='FNanchor_0036'></a><a href='#Footnote_0036' class='fnanchor'>[44]</a> long since forgotten, which contains
the efforts of a group of young University
Liberals to refute the arguments used by him
and by Lord Cairns, the strongest of his allies,
in their opposition to schemes of parliamentary
reform.</p>
<p>To compare the optimism of these young
writers and Lowe&rsquo;s pessimism with what has
actually come to pass is a not uninstructive
task. True it is that England has had only
thirty-five years&rsquo; experience of the Reform Act
of 1867, and only seventeen years&rsquo; experience
of that even greater step towards pure democracy
which was effected by the Franchise and
Redistribution Acts of 1884-85. We are still
far from knowing what sorts of Parliaments and
policies the enlarged suffrage will end by giving.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
But some at least of the mischiefs Lowe foretold
have not arrived. He expected first of all a
rapid increase in corruption and intimidation at
parliamentary elections. The quality of the
House of Commons would decline, because money
would rule, and small boroughs would no longer
open the path by which talent could enter.
Members would be either millionaires or demagogues,
and they would also become far more
subservient to their constituents. Universal
suffrage would soon arrive, because no halting-place
between the &pound;10 franchise<a name='FNanchor_0037' id='FNanchor_0037'></a><a href='#Footnote_0037' class='fnanchor'>[45]</a> and universal
suffrage could be found. Placed on a democratic
basis, the House of Commons would not be able
to retain its authority over the Executive. The
House of Lords, the Established Church, the
judicial bench (in that dignity and that independence
which are essential to its usefulness), would
be overthrown as England passed into &ldquo;the bare
and level plain of democracy where every ant-hill
is a mountain and every thistle a forest tree.&rdquo;
These and the other features characteristic of
popular government on which Lowe savagely
descanted were pieced together out of Plato and
Tocqueville, coupled with his own disagreeable
experiences of Australian politics. None of the
predicted evils can be said to have as yet become
features of the polity and government of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
England,<a name='FNanchor_0038' id='FNanchor_0038'></a><a href='#Footnote_0038' class='fnanchor'>[46]</a> though the power of the House relatively
to the Cabinet does seem to be declining.
Yet some of Lowe&rsquo;s incidental remarks are true,
and not least true is his prediction that democracies
will be found just as prone to war, just as apt to
be swept away by passion, as other kinds of
government have been. Few signs herald the
approach of that millennium of peace and enlightenment
which Cobden foretold and for which
Gladstone did not cease to hope.</p>
<p>No one since Lowe has taken up the part of
<i>advocatus diaboli</i> against democracy which he
played in 1866.<a name='FNanchor_0039' id='FNanchor_0039'></a><a href='#Footnote_0039' class='fnanchor'>[47]</a> Since Disraeli passed the Household
Suffrage in Boroughs Bill in 1867, a nullification
of Lowe&rsquo;s triumph which incensed him
more than ever against Disraeli, no one has ever
come forward in England as the avowed enemy
of changes designed to popularise our government.
Parties have quarrelled over the time and
the manner of extensions of the franchise, but the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
issue of principle raised in 1866 has not been
raised again. Even in 1884, when Mr. Gladstone
carried his bill for assimilating the county franchise
to that existing in boroughs, the Tory party did
not oppose the measure in principle, but confined
themselves to insisting that it should be accompanied
by a scheme for the redistribution of seats.
The secret, first unveiled by Disraeli, that the
masses will as readily vote for the Tory party as
for the Liberal, is now common property, and
universal suffrage, when it comes to be offered, is
as likely to be offered by the former party as by
the latter. This gives a touch of historical interest
to Lowe&rsquo;s speeches of 1866. They are the
swan-song of the old constitutionalism. The
changes which came in 1867 and 1884 must have
come sooner or later, for they were in the natural
line of development as we see it all over the
world; but they might have come much later
had not Lowe&rsquo;s opposition wrecked the moderate
scheme of 1866. Apart from that episode Lowe&rsquo;s
career would now be scarcely remembered, or
would be remembered by those who knew his
splendid gifts as an illustration of the maxim that
mere intellectual power does not stand first among
the elements of character that go to the winning
of a foremost place.</p>

<h2>WILLIAM ROBERTSON SMITH</h2>
</div>
<p>Robertson Smith,<a name='FNanchor_0040' id='FNanchor_0040'></a><a href='#Footnote_0040' class='fnanchor'>[48]</a> the most widely learned and
one of the most powerful teachers that either
Cambridge or Oxford could show during the
years of his residence in England, died at the
age of forty-seven on the 31st of March 1894.
To the English public generally his name was
little known, or was remembered only in connection
with the theological controversy and ecclesiastical
trial of which he had been the central figure
in Scotland fifteen years before. But on the
Continent of Europe and by Orientalists generally
he was regarded as the foremost Semitic scholar
of Britain, and by those who knew him as one of
the most remarkable men of his time.</p>
<p>He was born in 1846 in the quiet pastoral
valley of the Don, in Aberdeenshire. His father,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
who was a minister of the Scottish Free Church
in the parish of Keig, possessed high mathematical
talent, and his mother, who survived him six years,
was a woman of great force of character, who
retained till her death, at seventy-six years of
age, the full exercise of her keen intelligence.
Smith went straight from his father&rsquo;s teaching to
the University of Aberdeen, and after graduating
there, continued his studies first at Bonn in 1865,
and afterwards at G&ouml;ttingen (1869). When only
twenty-four he became Professor of Oriental
Languages in the College or Divinity School of
the Free Church at Aberdeen, and two years
later was chosen one of the revisers of the Old
Testament, a striking honour for so young a
man. In 1881 he became first assistant-editor
and then editor-in-chief of the ninth edition of the
<i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>. He was exceptionally
qualified for the post by the variety of his attainments
and by the extreme quickness of his mind,
which rapidly acquired knowledge on almost any
kind of subject. Those who knew him are agreed
that among all the eminent men who have been
connected with this great <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia</i> from its
first beginning nearly a century and a half ago until
now, he was surpassed by none, if equalled by any,
in the range of his learning and in the capacity to
bring learning to bear upon editorial work. He
took infinite pains to find the most competent
writers, and was able to exercise effective personal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
supervision over a very large proportion of
the articles. The ninth edition was much fuller
and more thorough than any of its predecessors;
and good as the first twelve volumes were, a still
higher level of excellence was attained in the latter
half, a result due to his industry and discernment.
Not a few of the articles on subjects connected
with the Old Testament were from his own pen;
and they were among the best in the work.</p>
<p>The appearance of one of them, that entitled
&ldquo;Bible,&rdquo; which contained a general view of the
history of the canonical books of Scripture, their
dates, authorship, and reception by the Christian
Church, became a turning-point in his life. The
propositions he stated regarding the origin of
parts of the Old Testament, particularly the
Pentateuch, excited alarm and displeasure in
Scotland, where few persons had become aware
of the conclusions reached by recent Biblical
scholars in Continental Europe. The article
was able, clear, and fearless, plainly the work
of a master hand. The views it advanced were
not for the most part due to Smith&rsquo;s own investigations,
but were to be found in the writings
of other learned men. Neither would they now
be thought extreme; they are in fact accepted to-day
by many writers of unquestioned orthodoxy
in Britain and a (perhaps smaller) number in the
United States. In 1876, however, these views
were new and startling to those who had not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
studied in Germany or followed the researches of
such men as Ewald, Kuenen, and Wellhausen.
The Scottish Free Church had theretofore prided
itself upon the rigidity of its orthodoxy; and while
among the younger ministers there were a good
many able and learned scholars holding what used
to be called &ldquo;advanced views,&rdquo; the mass of the
elder and middle-aged clergy had gone on in the
old-fashioned traditions of verbal inspiration, and
took every word in the Five Books (except the
last chapter of Deuteronomy) to have been written
down by Moses. It was only natural that their
anger should be kindled against the young professor,
whose theories seemed to cut away the
ground from under their feet. Proceedings were
(1876) taken against him before the Presbytery
of Aberdeen, and the case found its way thence
to the Synod of Aberdeen, and ultimately to the
General Assembly of the Free Church. In one
form or another (for the flame was lit anew by
other articles published by him in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>)
it lingered on for five years. So far from
yielding to the storm, Robertson Smith defied it,
maintaining not only the truth of his views, but
their compatibility with the Presbyterian standards
as contained in the Confession of Faith and the
Longer and Shorter Catechisms. In this latter
contention he was successful, proving that the
divines of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
had not committed themselves to any specific
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
doctrine of inspiration, still less to any dogmatic
deliverance as to the authorship of particular
books of Scripture. The standards simply declared
that the Word of God was contained in the
canonical books, and as there had been little or
no controversy between Protestants and Roman
Catholics regarding the date or the authorship or
the divine authority of those books (apart of
course from disputes regarding the Apocrypha),
had not dealt specifically with those last mentioned
matters. As it was by reference to the
Confession of Faith that the offence alleged had
to be established, Smith made good his defence;
so in the end, finding it impossible to convict him
of deviation from the standards, and thereby to
deal with him as an ordained minister of the
Church, his adversaries fell back on the plan
of depriving him, by an executive rather than
judicial vote, not indeed of his clerical status,
but of his professorship, on the ground of the
alleged &ldquo;unsettling character&rdquo; of his teaching.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, however, there had been an immense
rally to him of the younger clergy and
of the less conservative among the laity. The
main current of Scottish popular thought and
life had ever since the Reformation flowed in
an ecclesiastical channel; and even nowadays,
when Scotland is rapidly becoming Anglicised,
a theological or ecclesiastical question excites a
wider and keener interest there than a similar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
question would do in England. So in Scotland
for four years &ldquo;the Robertson Smith case&rdquo; was
the chief topic of discussion outside as well as
inside the Free Church. The sympathy felt for
the accused was heightened by the ingenuity,
energy, and courage with which he defended his
position, showing a power of argument and
repartee which made it plain that he would
have held a distinguished place in any assembly
whatever. If his debating had a fault, it was
that of being almost too dialectically cogent, so
that his antagonists felt that they were being
foiled on the form of the argument before they
could get to the issues they sought to raise.
But while he was an accomplished lawyer in
matters of form, he was no less an accomplished
theologian in matters of substance. Although the
party of repression triumphed so far as to deprive
him of his chair, the victory virtually remained
with him, not only because he had shown that the
Scottish Presbyterian standards did not condemn
the views he held, but also because his defence
and the discussions which it occasioned had, in
bringing those views to the knowledge of a great
number of thoughtful laymen, led such persons
to reconsider their own position. Some of them
found themselves forced to agree with Smith.
Others, who distrusted their capacity for arriving
at a conclusion, came at least to think that the
questions involved did not affect the essentials of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
faith, and must be settled by the ordinary canons
of historical and philological criticism. Thus the
trial proved to be a turning-point for the Scottish
Churches, much as the <i>Essays and Reviews</i> case
had been for the Church of England eighteen
years earlier. Opinions formerly proscribed were
thereafter freely expressed. Nearly all the doctrinal
prosecutions subsequently attempted in
the Scottish Presbyterian Churches have failed.
Much feeling has been excited, but the result
has been to secure a greater latitude than was
dreamt of forty years ago. At first the rigidly
orthodox section of the Free Church, now
almost confined to the Highlands, thought of
seceding from the main body on the ground
that tolerance was passing into indifference or
unbelief. But the new ideas continued to grow,
and the sentiment in favour of letting clergymen
as well as lay church members put a lax construction
on the doctrinal standards drawn up in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, has spread
as widely in Scotland as in England. The Presbyterian
Churches in America and the Roman
Catholic Church now stand almost alone among
the larger Christian bodies in retaining something
of the ancient rigidity. Even the Roman
Church begins to feel the solvent power of these
researches. It may be conjectured that as the
process of adjusting the letter of Scripture to the
conclusions of science which Galileo was not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
permitted to apply in the field of astronomy has
now been generally applied in the fields of geology
and biology, so all the churches will presently reconcile
themselves to the conclusions of historical
and linguistic criticism, now that such criticism
has become truly scientific in its methods.</p>
<p>Having no longer any tie to Scotland, as he
had never desired a pastoral charge there, since
he felt his vocation to lie in study and teaching,
Smith was hesitating which way to turn, when the
offer of the Lord Almoner&rsquo;s Readership in Arabic,
which had become vacant in 1883, determined
him to settle in Cambridge. He had travelled
in Arabia a few years earlier, thereby adding a
colloquial familiarity to his grammatical mastery
of the language. He was an ardent student of
Arabic literature, and indeed devoted more time
to it than to Hebrew. Though he had felt
deeply the attacks made upon him, and was
indignant at the mode of his dismissal, he was
not in the least dispirited; and his self-control
was shown by the way in which he resisted the
temptation, to which controversialists are prone,
of going further than they originally meant and
thereby damaging the position of their supporters.
Still, he was weary of controversy, and pleased to
see before him a prospect of learned quiet and
labour, although the salary of the Readership
was less than &pound;100 a year. Fortunately he
had come to a place where gifts like his were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
appreciated. The Master and Fellows of Christ&rsquo;s
College elected him to a fellowship with no
duties of tuition attached to it&mdash;a wise and graceful
recognition of his merits which did them the
more credit because they had very little personal
knowledge of him, while he had possessed no
prior tie with the University. Christ&rsquo;s is one of
the smaller colleges, but has almost always had
men of distinction among its fellows, and has maintained
a high standard of teaching. In the list of
its alumni stand the names of John Milton, Isaac
Barrow, Ralph Cudworth, and Charles Darwin.
Robertson Smith dwelt in it for the rest of his
days, entering into the life of hall and common-room
with great zest, for he was of an extremely
sociable turn, and the College became proud of
him. When a vacancy occurred in the office of
University Librarian, he was chosen to fill it.
His knowledge of and fondness for books fitted
him excellently for the place, but the details of
administration worried him, and it was a change
for the better when (in 1889), on the death
of his friend, William Wright, he became Professor
of Arabic.<a name='FNanchor_0041' id='FNanchor_0041'></a><a href='#Footnote_0041' class='fnanchor'>[49]</a> His efforts to build up a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
school of Oriental studies on the foundations laid
by Wright, and with the help of an eminent
Syriac scholar, Bensley, were proving successful,
and a considerable number of able young men
were gathering round him, when (in 1890) the
hand of disease fell upon him, obliging him first
to curtail and afterwards to intermit his lectures.
The last year of his life was a year of suffering,
borne with uncomplaining fortitude.</p>
<p>What with work on the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>,
with the distractions of his prolonged trial,
with the time spent in oral teaching, and with
the physical weakness of his latest years, Smith&rsquo;s
leisure available for literary production was not
large, and the books he has left do not adequately
represent either his accumulated knowledge or
his faculty of investigation. The earlier books&mdash;<i>The
Old Testament in the Jewish Church</i> and
<i>The Prophets of Israel</i> (the latter a series of
lectures delivered at Glasgow)&mdash;are comparatively
popular in handling. The two later&mdash;<i>Kinship
and Marriage in Early Arabia</i> and <i>The Religion
of the Semites</i>&mdash;are more abstruse and technical,
and also more original, dealing with topics in
which their author was a pioneer, though he
had been influenced by, and acknowledged in
the amplest way his obligations to, his friend
John F. Maclennan, the author of <i>Primitive
Marriage</i>. <i>The Religion of the Semites</i>, though
masterly in plan and execution, and though it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
has excited the admiration of the few Oriental
scholars competent to appraise its substantial
merit, suffers from its incompleteness. Only
the first volume was published, for death overtook
the author before he could put into
final shape the materials he had collected for the
full development of his theories. As the second
volume would have traced the connection between
the primitive religion of the Arab branches of the
Semitic stock (including Israel) and the Hebrew
religion as we have it in the earlier books of the Old
Testament, the absence of this finished statement
is a loss to science. Changes had passed upon
his views since he wrote the incriminated articles,
and he said to me (I think about 1888) that he
would no longer undertake any clerical duties.
He had a sensitive conscience, and held that no
clergyman ought to use language in the pulpit
which did not express his personal convictions.</p>
<p>What struck one most in Robertson Smith&rsquo;s
writings was the easy command wherewith he
handled his materials. His generalisations were
based on an endlessly patient and careful study of
details, a study in which he never lost sight of
guiding principles. With perfect lucidity and an
unstrained natural vigour, there was a sense of
abounding and overflowing knowledge which inspired
confidence in the reader, making him feel
he was in the hands of a master. On all that
pertained to the languages and literature of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
Arabic branch of the Semitic races, ancient and
modern (for he did not claim to be an Assyriologist),
his knowledge was accurate no less than
comprehensive. Full of deference to the great
scholars&mdash;no one spoke with a warmer admiration
of N&ouml;ldeke, Wellhausen, and Lagarde than he did&mdash;he
was a stringent critic of unscientific work in
the sphere of history and physics as well as in
that of philology, quick to expose the uncritical
assumptions or loose hypotheses of less careful
though more pretentious students. He used to
say that when he had disposed of the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica</i>, he might undertake a &ldquo;Dictionary of
European Impostors.&rdquo; Oriental lore was only
one of many subjects in which he might have
achieved distinction. His mathematical talents
were remarkable, and during two sessions he
taught with conspicuous success the class of
Natural Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh
as assistant professor. He had a competent
acquaintance with not a few other practical
arts, including navigation, and once, when the
compasses of the vessel on which he was sailing
in the Red Sea got out of order, he proved to be
the person on board most competent to set them
right. In metaphysics and theology, in ancient
history and many departments of modern history,
he was thoroughly at home. Few, indeed, were
the subjects that came up in the course of conversation
on which he was not able to throw light,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
for the range of his acquirements was not more
striking than the swiftness and precision with
which he brought knowledge to bear wherever
it was wanted.</p>
<p>There was hardly a line of practical life in
which he might not have attained a brilliant
success. But the passion for knowledge made
him prefer the life of a scholar, and seemed to
have quenched any desire even for literary fame.</p>
<p>Learning is commonly thought of as a weight
to be carried, which makes men dull, heavy, or
pedantic. With Robertson Smith the effect seemed
to be exactly the opposite. Because he knew so
much, he was interested in everything, and threw
himself with a joyous freshness and keenness into
talk alike upon the most serious and the lightest
topics. He was combative, apt to traverse a proposition
when first advanced, even though he might
come round to it afterwards; and a discussion
with him taxed the defensive acumen of his
companions. Having once spent five weeks
alone with him in a villa at Alassio on the
Riviera, I observed to him when we parted
that we had had (as the Americans say) &ldquo;a
lovely time&rdquo; together, and that there was not
an observation I had made during those weeks
which he had not contested. He laughed
and did not contest that observation. Yet this
tendency, while it made his society more stimulating,
did not make it less agreeable, because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
he never seemed to seek to overthrow an
adversary, but only to get at the truth of the
case, and his manner, though positive, had about
it nothing either acrid or conceited. One could
imagine no keener intellectual pleasure than his
company afforded, for there was, along with an
exuberant wealth of thought and knowledge, an
intensity and ardour which lit up every subject
which it touched. I once invited him and John
Richard Green (the historian) to meet at dinner.
They took to one another at once, nor was it easy
to say which lamp burned the brighter. Smith
had wider and more accurate learning, and stronger
logical power, but Green was just as swift, just as
fertile, just as ingenious. In stature Smith, like
Green, was small, almost diminutive; his dark
brown eyes bright and keen; his speech rapid;
his laugh ready and merry, for he had a quick
sense of humour and a power of enjoying things
as they came. The type of intellect suggested
a Teutonic Scot of the Lowlands, but in appearance
and temperament he was rather a Scottish
Celt of the Highlands, with a fire and a gaiety,
an abounding vivacity and vitality, which made
him a conspicuous figure wherever he lived, in
Aberdeen, in Edinburgh, in Cambridge. Even
by his walk, with its quick, irregular roll, one could
single him out at a distance in the street.</p>
<p>When a man is attractive personally, he is
all the more attractive for being unlike other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
men, and he often becomes the centre of a
group. This was the case with Smith. His
numerous friends were so much interested by
him that when they met their talk was largely
of him, and many friendships were based on
a common knowledge of this one person. Indeed,
the geniality, elevation, and simplicity of
his character gave him a quite unusual hold on
those who had come to know him well. Few
men, leading an equally quiet and studious life,
have inspired so much regard and affection in so
large a number of persons; few teachers have had
an equal power of stimulating and attracting their
pupils. He loved teaching hardly less than he
loved the investigation of truth, and he was the
most faithful and sympathetic of friends, one
who was felt to be unique while he lived and
irreplaceable when he had departed.</p>
<p>I have spoken of the courage he had shown
in confronting his antagonists in the ecclesiastical
courts. That courage did not fail him in the
severer trials of his last illness. The nature of
the disease of which he died was disclosed to
him by his physician in September 1892, while
an international Congress of Orientalists, in which
he presided over the Semitic section, was holding
its meetings. A festival dinner was being given
in honour of the Congress the same afternoon.
When the physician had spoken, Smith simply
remarked, &ldquo;This means the death my brother
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
died&rdquo; (one of his brothers had been struck by
the same malady a few years before). He went
straight to the dinner, and was throughout the
evening the gayest and brightest of the guests.</p>
<p>Fancy sometimes indulges herself in imagining
what part the eminent men one has known would
have played had their lot been cast in some other
age. So I have fancied that Archbishop Tait
(described in an earlier chapter) ought to have
been Primate of England under Edward the
Sixth or Elizabeth. He would have guided the
course of reform more prudently and more firmly
than Cranmer did; he would have shown a broader
spirit than did Parker or Whitgift. So Cardinal
Manning, had he lived in the seventeenth century,
might haply have become General of the Jesuit
Order, and enjoyed the secret control of the politics
of the Catholic world. So Robertson Smith, had
he been born in the great age of the medi&aelig;val
universities, might, like the bold dialectician of
whom Dante speaks, have &ldquo;syllogised invidious
truths&rdquo;<a name='FNanchor_0042' id='FNanchor_0042'></a><a href='#Footnote_0042' class='fnanchor'>[50]</a> in the University of Paris; or had Fortune
placed him two centuries later among the scholars
of the Italian Renaissance in its glorious prime,
the fame of his learning might have filled half
Europe.</p>

<a name='HENRY_SIDGWICK' id='HENRY_SIDGWICK'></a>
<h2>HENRY SIDGWICK</h2>
</div>
<p>Henry Sidgwick was born at Skipton, in Yorkshire,
where his father was headmaster of the
ancient grammar school of the town, on 31st
May 1838.<a name='FNanchor_0043' id='FNanchor_0043'></a><a href='#Footnote_0043' class='fnanchor'>[51]</a> The family belonged to Yorkshire.
He was a precocious boy, and used to delight his
brothers and sister by the fertility of his imagination
in inventing games and stories. Educated
at Rugby School under Goulburn (afterwards
Dean of Norwich), he was sent at an unusually
early age to Trinity College, Cambridge. His
brilliant University career was crowned by the
first place in the classical tripos and by a first
class in the mathematical tripos, and he was
speedily elected a Fellow of Trinity. Intellectual
curiosity and an interest in the problems
of theology presently drew him to Germany,
where he worked at Hebrew and Arabic under
Ewald at G&ouml;ttingen, as well as with other
eminent teachers. After hesitating for a time
whether to devote himself to Oriental studies
or to classical scholarship, he was drawn back to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
philosophy by his desire to investigate questions
bearing on natural theology, and finally settled
down to the pursuit of what are called in Cambridge
the moral sciences&mdash;metaphysics, ethics, and
psychology; becoming first a College Lecturer
and then (in 1875) a University Pr&aelig;lector in
these subjects. In 1869 he resigned his fellowship,
feeling that he could no longer consider
himself a &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i> member of the Church of
England,&rdquo; that being the condition then attached
by law to the holding of fellowships in the
Colleges at Cambridge. This step caused surprise,
for the test was deemed a very vague and light
one, having been recently substituted for a more
stringent requirement, and there had been many
holders of fellowships who were at least as little
entitled to call themselves <i>bona fide</i> members
of the Established Church as he was. But,
as was afterwards said of him by Mrs. Cross
(George Eliot), Sidgwick was expected by his
intimate friends to conform to standards higher
than average men prescribe for their own conduct.
Taken in conjunction with the fact that
several English Dissenters and Scottish Presbyterians
had won the distinction of a Senior
Wranglership and been debarred from fellowships,
though they were in theological opinion more
orthodox than some nominal members of the
Established Church who were holding fellowships,
Sidgwick&rsquo;s conscientious act made a great impression
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
in Cambridge and did much to hasten
that total abolition of tests in the Universities
which was effected by statute in 1871; for in
England concrete instances of hardship and injustice
are more powerful incitements to reform
than the strongest abstract arguments, and Sidgwick
was already so eminent and so respected
a figure that all Cambridge felt the absurdity of
excluding such a man from its honours and emoluments.
In 1883 he was appointed Professor of
Moral Philosophy, and continued to hold that post
till three months before his death in 1900, when
failing health determined him to resign it.</p>
<p>His life was the still and tranquil life of the
thinker, teacher, and writer, varied by no events
more exciting than those controversies over
reforms in the studies and organisation of the
University in which his sense of public duty
frequently led him to bear a part.</p>
<p>These I pass over, but there is one branch of
his active work to which special reference ought
to be made, viz. the part he took in promoting the
University education of women. In or about the
year 1868 he joined with the late Miss Anne
Jane Clough (sister of the poet Arthur Clough)
and a few other friends in establishing a course
of lectures and a hall of residence for women
at Cambridge, which grew into the institution
called Newnham College. It and Girton College,
founded by other friends of the same cause
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
about the same time, were the first two institutions
in England which provided for women,
together with residential accommodation, a complete
University training equivalent and similar
to that provided by the two ancient English
universities for men. The teaching was mainly
given by the University professors and lecturers,
the curriculum was the same as the University
prescribed, and the women students, though not
legally admitted to the University, were examined
by the University examiners at the same
time as the other students. Henry Sidgwick
was, from the foundation of Newnham onwards,
the moving spirit and the guiding hand among
its University friends, the spirit which inspired
the policy and the hand which piloted the
fortunes of the College. Its growth to its present
dimensions, and its usefulness, not only directly,
but through the example it has set, have been
largely due to his assiduous care and temperate
wisdom. He had married (in 1876) Miss Eleanor
Mildred Balfour, and when she accepted the principalship
of Newnham after Miss Clough&rsquo;s death, in
1889, he and she transferred their residence to
the College, and lived thenceforward at it. The
England of our time has seen no movement of
opinion more remarkable or more beneficial than
that which has recognised the claims of women
to the highest kind of education, and secured a
substantial, if still incomplete, provision therefor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
The change has come so quietly and unobtrusively
that few people realise how great it
is. Few, indeed, remember what things were
forty years ago, as few realise when waste lands
have been stubbed and drained and tilled what
they were like in their former state. No one did
more than Sidgwick to bring about this change.
Besides his work for Newnham, he took a lead
in all the movements that have been made to
obtain for women a fuller admission to University
privileges, and well deserved the gratitude of
Englishwomen for his unceasing efforts on their
behalf.</p>
<p>The obscure problems of psychology had a
great attraction for him, and he spent much time
in investigating them, being one of the founders,
and remaining all through his later life a leading
and guiding member, of the Society for Psychical
Research, which has for the last twenty years
cultivated this field with an industry and ability
which have deserved larger harvests than have
yet been reaped. Two remarkable men, both
devoted friends of his, worked with him, Edmund
Gurney and Frederic Myers the poet, the latter
of whom survived him a few months only. It
was characteristic of Sidgwick that he never committed
himself to any of the bold and possibly
over-sanguine anticipations formed by some of
the other members of the Society, while yet he
never was deterred by failure, or by the discovery
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
of deceptions, sometimes elaborate and long sustained,
from pursuing inquiries which seemed to
him to have an ultimate promise of valuable
results. The phenomena, he would say, may be
true or false; anyhow they deserve investigation.
The mere fact that so many persons believe them
to be genuine is a problem fit to be investigated.
If they are false, it will be a service to have
proved them so. If they contain some truth,
it is truth of a kind so absolutely new as to be
worth much effort and long effort to reach it. In
any case, science ought to take the subject out of
the hands of charlatans.</p>
<p>The main business of his life, however, was
teaching and writing. Three books stand out as
those by which he will be best remembered&mdash;his
<i>Methods of Ethics</i>, his <i>Principles of Political
Economy</i>, and his <i>Elements of Politics</i>. All three
have won the admiration of those who are experts
in the subjects to which they respectively relate,
and they continue to be widely read in universities
both in Britain and in America. All
three bear alike the peculiar impress of his mind.</p>
<p>It was a mind of singular subtlety, fertility,
and ingenuity, which applied to every topic an
extremely minute and patient analysis. Never
satisfied with the obvious view of a question,
it seemed unable to acquiesce in any broad and
sweeping statement. It discovered objections to
every accepted doctrine, exceptions to every rule.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
It perceived minute distinctions and qualifications
which had escaped the notice of previous writers.
These qualities made Sidgwick&rsquo;s books somewhat
difficult reading for a beginner, who was apt to
ask what, after all, was the conclusion to which he
had been led by an author who showed him the
subject in various lights, and added not a few minor
propositions to that which had seemed to be the
governing one. But the student who had already
some knowledge of the topic, who, though he
apprehended its main principles, had not followed
them out in detail or perceived the difficulties in
applying them, gained immensely by having so
many fresh points presented to him, so many
fallacies lurking in currently accepted notions
detected, so many conditions indicated which
might qualify the amplitude of a general proposition.
The method of discussion was stimulating.
Sometimes it reminded one of the Socratic
method as it appears in Plato, but more frequently
it was the method of Aristotle, who
discusses a subject first from one side, then from
another, throws out a number of remarks, not
always reconcilable, but always suggestive, regarding
it, and finally arrives at a view which he
delivers as being probably the best, but one
which must be taken subject to the remarks
previously made. The reader often feels in
Sidgwick&rsquo;s treatment of a subject as he often
feels in Aristotle&rsquo;s, that he would like to be left
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
with something more definite and positive, something
that can be easily delivered to learners as
an established truth. He desires a bolder and
broader sweep of the brush. But he also feels
how much he is benefited by the process of
sifting and analysing to which every conception
or dogma is subjected, and he perceives that
he is more able to handle it afterwards in his
own way when his attention has been called to
all these distinctions and qualifications or antinomies
which would have escaped any vision less
keen than his author&rsquo;s. For those who, in an age
prone to hasty reading and careless thinking, are
disposed to underrate the difficulties of economic
and political questions, and to walk in a vain
conceit of knowledge because they have picked
up some large generalisations, no better discipline
can be prescribed than to follow patiently such
a treatment as Sidgwick gives; nor can any
reader fail to profit from the candour and the
love of truth which illumine his discussion of a
subject.</p>
<p>The love of truth and the sense of duty guided
his life as well as his pen. Though always
warmly interested in politics, he was of all the
persons I have known the least disposed to be
warped by partisanship, for he examined each
political issue as it arose on its own merits, apart
from predilections for either party or for the
views of his nearest friends. We used to wonder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
how such splendid impartiality would have stood a
practical test such as that of the House of Commons.
His loyalty to civic duty was so strong as
on one occasion to bring him, in the middle of
his vacation, all the way from Davos, in the
easternmost corner of Switzerland, to Cambridge,
solely that he might record his vote at a parliamentary
election, although the result of the election
was already virtually certain.</p>
<p>Sidgwick&rsquo;s attitude toward the Benthamite
system of Utilitarianism illustrates the cautiously
discriminative habit of mind I have sought to
describe. If he had been required to call himself
by any name, he would not have refused that
of Utilitarian, just as in mental philosophy he
leaned to the type of thought represented by the
two Mills rather than to the Kantian idealism of
his friend and school contemporary, the Oxford
professor T. H. Green. But the system of
Utility takes in his hands a form so much more
refined and delicate than was given to it by
Bentham and James Mill, and is expounded with
so many qualifications unknown to them, that it
has become a very different thing, and is scarcely,
if at all, assailable by the arguments which moralists
of the idealistic type have brought against
the older doctrine. Something similar may be
said of his treatment of bimetallism in his book
on political economy. While assenting to some of
the general propositions on which the bimetallic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
theory rests, he points out so many difficulties in
the application of that theory to the actual conditions
of currency that his assent cannot be cited
as a deliverance in favour of trying to turn theory
into practice. He told me in 1896 that he held
the political and other practical objections to an
attempt to establish a bimetallic system to be virtually
insuperable. When he treats of free trade, he
is no less guarded and discriminating. He points
out various circumstances or conditions under
which a protective tariff may become, at least
for a time, justifiable, but never abandons the
free trade principle as being generally true and
sound, a principle not to be departed from
save for strong reasons of a local or temporary
kind. His general economic position is equally
removed from the &ldquo;high and dry&rdquo; school of
Ricardo on the one hand, and from the &ldquo;Katheder-Sozialisten&rdquo;
and the modern &ldquo;sentimental&rdquo; school
on the other. In all his books one notes a tendency
to discover what can be said for the view
which is in popular disfavour, even often for
that which he does not himself adopt, and to
set forth all the objections to the view which
is to receive his ultimate adhesion. There is a
danger with such a method of losing breadth and
force of effect. One is ready to cry, &ldquo;Do lapse
for a moment into dogmatism.&rdquo; Yet it ought to be
added that Sidgwick&rsquo;s subtlety is always restrained
by practical good sense, as well as by the desire to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
reconcile opposite views. His arguments, though
they often turn on minute distinctions, are not
bits of fine-drawn ingenuity, but have weight and
substance in them.<a name='FNanchor_0044' id='FNanchor_0044'></a><a href='#Footnote_0044' class='fnanchor'>[52]</a></p>
<p>One book of his which has not yet (December
1902) been published, but which I have had the
privilege of reading in proof, displays his constructive
power in another light. It is a course
of lectures on the development of political institutions
in Europe from early times down to our
own. Here, as he is dealing with concrete matter,
the treatment is more broad, and the line of
exposition and argument more easy to follow, than
in the treatises already referred to. It is a masterly
piece of work, and reveals a wider range of
historical knowledge and a more complete mastery
of historical method than had been shown in his
earlier books, or indeed than some of his friends
had known him to possess.</p>
<p>The tendency to analysis rather than to construction,
the abstention from the deliverance of
doctrines easy to comprehend and repeat, which
belong to his writings on ethics and economics,
do not impair the worth of his literary criticisms.
In this field his fine perception and discriminative
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
taste had full scope. He was an incessant reader,
especially of poetry and novels, with a retentive
memory for poetry, as well as a finely modulated
and expressive voice in reciting it. His literary
judgments had less of a creative quality, if the
expression be permissible, than Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s,
but are not otherwise inferior to those of that
brilliant though sometimes slightly prejudiced
critic. No one of his contemporaries has surpassed
Sidgwick in catholicity and reasonableness,
in the power of delicate appreciation, or in an
exquisite precision of expression. His essay on
Arthur Hugh Clough, prefixed to the latest edition
of Clough&rsquo;s collected poems, is a good specimen
of this side of his talent. Clough was one of
his favourites, and has indeed been called the
pet poet of University men. Sidgwick&rsquo;s literary
essays, which appeared occasionally in magazines,
were few, but they well deserve to be collected and
republished, for this age of ours, though largely
occupied in talking about literature, has produced
comparatively little criticism of the first order.</p>
<p>Sidgwick did not write swiftly or easily, because
he weighed carefully everything he wrote.
But his mind was alert and nimble in the highest
degree. Thus he was an admirable talker, seeing
in a moment the point of an argument, seizing on
distinctions which others had failed to perceive,
suggesting new aspects from which a question
might be regarded, and enlivening every topic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
by a keen yet sweet and kindly wit. Wit,
seldom allowed to have play in his books,
was one of the characteristics which made his
company charming. Its effect was heightened
by a hesitation in his speech which often
forced him to pause before the critical word
or phrase of the sentence had been reached.
When that word or phrase came, it was sure
to be the right one. Though fond of arguing,
he was so candid and fair, admitting all that
there was in his opponent&rsquo;s case, and obviously
trying to see the point from his opponent&rsquo;s side,
that nobody felt annoyed at having come off
second best, while everybody who cared for good
talk went away feeling not only that he knew
more about the matter than he did before, but
that he had enjoyed an intellectual pleasure of a
rare and high kind. The keenness of his penetration
was not formidable, because it was joined
to an indulgent judgment: the ceaseless activity
of his intellect was softened rather than reduced
by the gaiety of his manner. His talk was conversation,
not discourse, for though he naturally
became the centre of nearly every company in
which he found himself, he took no more than
his share. It was like the sparkling of a brook
whose ripples seem to give out sunshine.</p>
<p>Though Sidgwick&rsquo;s writings are a mine of
careful and suggestive thinking, he was even
more remarkable than his books. Though his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
conversation was delightful, the impression of its
fertility and its wit was the least part of the
impression which his personality produced. An
eminent man is known to the world at large by
what he gives them in the way of instruction or
of pleasure. A man is prized and remembered
by his friends for what he was in the intercourse
of life. Few men of our time have influenced
so wide or so devoted a circle of friends as did
Henry Sidgwick; few could respond to the calls
of friendship with a like sympathy or wisdom.
His advice was frequently asked in delicate
questions of conduct, and he was humorously
reminded that, by his own capacity as well as
by the title of his chair, he was a professor of
casuistry. His stores of knowledge and helpful
criticism were always at the service of his pupils
or his fellow-workers.</p>
<p>From his earliest college days he had been
just, well-balanced, conscientious alike in the pursuit
of truth and in the regulation of his own life,
appearing to have neither prejudices nor enmities,
and when he had to convey censure, choosing the
least cutting words in which to convey it. Yet
in earlier years there had been in him a touch
of austerity, a certain remoteness or air of detachment,
which confined to a very few persons
the knowledge of his highest qualities. As he
grew older his purity lost its coldness, his keenness
of discernment mellowed into a sweet and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
persuasive wisdom. A life excellently conducted,
a life which is the expression of fine qualities, and
in which the acts done are in harmony with the
thoughts and words of the man, is itself a beautiful
product, whether of untutored nature or of
thought and experience turning every faculty to
the best account. In the modern world the two
types of excellence which we are chiefly bidden
to admire are that of the active philanthropist
and that of the saint. The ancient world produced
and admired another type, to which some
of its noblest characters conformed, and which, in
its softer and more benignant aspect, Sidgwick
presented. In his indifference to wealth and
fame and the other familiar objects of human
desire, in the almost ascetic simplicity of his daily
life, in his pursuit of none but the purest pleasures,
in his habit of subjecting all impulses to the law
of reason, the will braced to patience, the soul
brought into harmony with the divinely appointed
order, he seemed to reproduce one of those philosophers
of antiquity who formed a lofty conception
of Nature and sought to live in conformity
with her precepts. But the gravity of a Stoic
was relieved by the humour and vivacity which
belonged to his nature, and the severity of a Stoic
was softened by the tenderness and sympathy
which seemed to grow and expand with every
year. In Cambridge, where, though the society
is a large one, all the teachers become personally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
known to one another, and the students have
opportunities of familiar intercourse with the
teachers, affection as well as admiration gathered
round him. His thoughts quickened and his
example inspired generation after generation of
young men passing through the University out
into the life of England, as a light set high upon
the bank beams on the waves of a river gliding
swiftly to the sea.</p>
<p>It was a life of single-minded devotion to truth
and friendship, a life serene and gentle, free alike
from vanity and from ambition, bearing without
complaint the ill-health which sometimes checked
his labours, viewing with calm fortitude those
problems of man&rsquo;s life on which his mind was
always fixed, untroubled in the presence of death.</p>

<p>When his friends heard of his departure there
rose to mind the words in which the closing scene of
the life of Socrates is described by the greatest of
his disciples, and we thought that among all those
we had known there was none of whom we could
more truly say that in him the spirit of philosophy
had its perfect work in justice, in goodness, and
in wisdom.</p>

<p>Ever since the publication of Stanley&rsquo;s Life of
Dr. Arnold that eminent headmaster has been
taken as the model of a great teacher and ruler
of boys, the man who, while stimulating the intelligence
of his pupils, was even more concerned
to discipline and mould their moral natures.
Arnold has become the type of what Carlyle
might have called &ldquo;The Hero as Schoolmaster.&rdquo;
Though there have been many able men at the
head of large schools since his time, including
three who afterwards rose to be Archbishops of
Canterbury, as well as a good many who have
become bishops, his fame remains unrivalled, and
the type created by his career, or rather perhaps by
his biographer&rsquo;s account of it, still holds the field.
Moreover, during the sixty years that have passed
since Arnold&rsquo;s death scarcely a word has been
said regarding any other masters than the head.
During those years the English universities have
sent into the great schools a large proportion of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
their most capable graduates as assistant teachers;
and some of the strongest men among these
graduates have never, from various causes, and
often because they preferred to remain laymen,
been raised to the headships of the schools.
Every one knows that a school depends for its
wellbeing and success more largely on the assistants
taken together than it does on the headmaster.
Most people also know that individual
assistant masters are not unfrequently better
scholars, better teachers, and more influential
with the boys than is their official superior. Yet
the assistant masters have remained unhonoured
and unsung in the general chorus of praise of the
great schools which has been resounding over
England for nearly two generations.</p>
<p>Edward Bowen was all his life an assistant
master, and never cared to be anything else. As
he had determined not to take orders in the Church
of England, he was virtually debarred from many
of the chief headmasterships, which are, some few
of them by law, many more by custom, confined
to Anglican clergymen. But even when other
headships to which this condition was not attached
were known to be practically open to his acceptance,
were, indeed, in one or two instances almost
tendered to him, he refused to become a candidate,
preferring his own simple and easy way of life
to the pomp and circumstance which convention
requires a headmaster to maintain. This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
abstention, however, did not prevent his eminence
from becoming known to those who had opportunities
of judging. In his later years he would,
I think, have been generally recognised by the
teaching profession as the most brilliant, and in
his own peculiar line the most successful, man
among the schoolmasters of Britain.</p>
<p>He was born on 30th March 1836, of an Irish
family (originally from Wales) holding property
in the county of Mayo. His father was a clergyman
of the Church of England; his mother,
who survived him a few months (dying at the
age of ninety-four) and whom he tended with
watchful care during her years of widowhood,
was partly of Irish, partly of French extraction.
Like his more famous but perhaps not more
remarkable elder brother, Charles Bowen, who
became Lord Bowen, and is remembered as
one of the most acute and subtle judges as
well as one of the most winning personalities
of our time, he had a gaiety, wit, and versatility
which suggested the presence of Celtic blood.
He was educated at Blackheath School, and
afterwards at King&rsquo;s College in London, whence
he proceeded to Trinity College, Cambridge.
In 1860, after a career at the University, distinguished
both in the way of honours and in
respect of the reputation he won among his
contemporaries, he became a master at Harrow,
and thenceforth remained there, leading an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
uneventful and externally a monotonous life,
but one full of unceasing and untiring activity
in play and work. He died on Easter Monday
1901.</p>
<p>Nothing could be less like the traditional
Arnoldine methods of teaching and ruling boys
than Bowen&rsquo;s method was. The note of those
methods was what used to be called moral
earnestness. Arnold was grave and serious,
distant and awe-inspiring, except perhaps to a
few specially favoured pupils. Bowen was light,
cheerful, vivacious, humorous, familiar, and, above
all things, ingenious and full of variety. His
leading principles were two&mdash;that the boy must
at all hazards be interested in the lessons and
that he should be at ease with the teacher.</p>
<p>A Harrow boy once said to his master,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it is, sir, but if Mr. Bowen
takes a lesson he makes you work twice as hard
as other masters, but you like it twice as much
and you learn far more.&rdquo; He was the most
unexpected man in conversation that could be
imagined, always giving a new turn to talk by
saying something that seemed remote from the
matter in hand until he presently showed the
connection. So his teaching kept the boys
alert, because its variety was inexhaustible. He
seemed to think that it did not greatly matter
what the lesson was so long as the pupil could be
got to enjoy it. The rules of the school and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
requirements of the examinations for which boys
had to be prepared would not have permitted
him to try to any great extent the experiment
of varying subjects to suit individual tastes; but
he was fond of giving lessons in topics outside
the regular course, on astronomy for instance, of
which he had acquired a fair knowledge, and on
recent military history, which he knew wonderfully
well, better probably than any man in England outside
the military profession. When the so-called
&ldquo;modern side&rdquo; was established at Harrow, in 1869,
he became head of it, having taken this post, not
from any want of classical taste and learning,
for he was an admirable scholar, and to the
end of his life wrote charming Latin verses, but
because he felt that this line of teaching needed
to be developed in a school which had been formerly
almost wholly classical. For grammatical
minuti&aelig;, for learning rules by heart, and indeed
for the old style of grammar-teaching generally,
he had an unconcealed contempt. He thought it
unkind and wasteful to let a boy go on puzzling
over difficulties of language in an author, and
permitted, under restrictions, the use of English
translations, or (as boys call them) &ldquo;cribs.&rdquo;
Teaching was in his view a special gift of
the individual, which depended on the aptitude
for getting hold of the pupil&rsquo;s mind, and
enlisting his interest in the subject. He
had accordingly no faith in the doctrine that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
teaching is a science which can be systematically
studied, or an art in which the apprentice ought to
be systematically trained. When he was summoned
as a witness before the Secondary Education
Commission in 1894 he adhered, under cross-examination,
to this view (so far as it affected
schools like Harrow or Eton), refusing to be
moved by the arguments of those among the
Commissioners who cited the practice of Germany,
where P&auml;dagogik, as they call it, is elaborately
taught in the universities. &ldquo;I am unable,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;to conceive any machinery by which the art of
teaching can be given practically to masters. That
art is so much a matter of personal power and experience,
and of various social and moral gifts,
that I cannot conceive a good person made a good
master by merely seeing a class of boys taught,
unless he was allowed to take a real and serious
part in it himself, unless he became a teacher himself.
I can understand that at a primary school you
can learn by going in and hearing a good teacher at
work; but the teaching of a class of older boys is
so different, and has so much of the social element
in it, and it may vary so much, that I should
despair of teaching a young man how to take a
class unless he was a long time with me.... A
master at a large public school is chiefly a moral
and social force; a master is this to a much less
extent at a primary school or in the ordinary day-schools,
the grammar-schools of the country. To
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
deal with boys when you have them completely
under your control for the whole of every day is
an altogether different thing, and requires different
virtues in the teacher from those that are required
in the case of day-schools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bowen may possibly have been mistaken, even
as regards the teachers in the great public boarding
schools. His view seems to overlook or
disregard that large class of persons who have no
marked natural aptitude for teaching, but are capable
of being, by special instruction and supervised
practice, kneaded and moulded into better teachers
than they would otherwise have grown to be. He
felt so strongly that no one ought to teach without
having a real gift and fondness for teaching that
he thought such difference as training could make
insignificant in comparison with the inborn talent.
Perhaps he generalised too boldly from himself,
for he had an enjoyment of his work, and a conscientiousness
in always putting the very best of
himself into it&mdash;how much was conscientiousness
and how much was enjoyment, no one could tell&mdash;as
well as a quickness and vivacity which no
study of methods could have improved. As one
of his most eminent colleagues,<a name='FNanchor_0045' id='FNanchor_0045'></a><a href='#Footnote_0045' class='fnanchor'>[54]</a> who was also his
life-long friend, observes: &ldquo;The humdrum and
routine which must form so large a part of a
teacher&rsquo;s life were never humdrum or routine to
him, for he put the whole of his abounding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
energies into his work, and round its driest details
there played and flickered, as with a lambent
flame, his joyous spirit, finding expression now
perhaps in a striking parallel, now in a startling
paradox, now in a touch of humour, and once
again in a note of pathos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The personal influence he exerted on the boys
who lived in his House was quite as remarkable
as his &ldquo;form-teaching.&rdquo; Stoicism and honour
were the qualities it was mainly directed to form.
Every boy was expected to show manliness and
endurance, and to utter no complaint. Where
physical health was concerned he was indulgent;
his House was the first which gave the boys meat
at breakfast in addition to tea with bread and
butter. But otherwise the discipline was Spartan,
though not more Spartan than that he prescribed
to himself, and the House was trained to scorn the
slightest approach to luxury. Arm-chairs were
forbidden except to sixth-form boys. A pupil
relates that when Bowen found he was in the habit
of taking two hot baths a week the transgression
was reproved with the words: &ldquo;Oh boy, that&rsquo;s
like the later Romans, boy.&rdquo; His maxims were:
&ldquo;Take sweet and bitter as sweet and bitter come&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Always play the game.&rdquo; He never preached
to the boys or lectured them; and if he had to
convey a reproof, conveyed it in a single sentence.
But he dwelt upon honour as the foundation of
character, and made every boy feel that he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
expected to reach the highest standard of truthfulness,
courage, and duty to the little community
of the House, or the cricket eleven, or the football
team.</p>
<p>Some have begun to think that in English
schools and universities too much time is given to
athletic sports, and that they absorb too largely
the thoughts and interests of the English youth.
Bowen, however, attached the utmost value to
games as a training in character. He used to
descant upon the qualities of discipline, good-fellowship,
good-humour, mutual help, and postponement
of self which they are calculated to
foster. Though some of his friends thought that
his own intense and unabated fondness for these
games&mdash;for he played cricket and football up to
the end of his life&mdash;might have biassed his judgment,
they could not deny that the games ought
to develop the qualities aforesaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consider the habit of being in public, the forbearance,
the subordination of the one to the many,
the exercise of judgment, the sense of personal
dignity. Think again of the organising faculty that
our games develop. Where can you get command
and obedience, choice with responsibility, criticism
with discipline, in any degree remotely approaching
that in which our social games supply them?
Think of the partly moral, partly physical side of it,
temper, of course, dignity, courtesy.... When the
match has really begun, there is education, there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
is enlargement of horizon, self sinks, the common
good is the only good, the bodily faculties exhilarate
in functional development, and the make-believe
ambition is glorified into a sort of ideality.
Here is boyhood at its best, or very nearly at its
best. <i>Sursum crura!...</i> When you have a lot
of human beings, in highest social union and
perfect organic action, developing the law of their
race and falling in unconsciously with its best
inherited traditions of brotherhood and common
action, you are not far from getting a glimpse of
one side of the highest good. There lives more
soul in honest play, believe me, than in half the
hymn-books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words, taken from a half-serious essay on
Games written for a private society, give some part
of Bowen&rsquo;s views. The whole essay is well worth
reading.<a name='FNanchor_0046' id='FNanchor_0046'></a><a href='#Footnote_0046' class='fnanchor'>[55]</a> Its arguments do not, however, quite
settle the matter. The playing of games may have,
and indeed ought to have, the excellent results
Bowen claimed for it, and yet it may be doubted
whether the experience of life shows that boys so
brought up do in fact turn out substantially more
good-humoured, unselfish, and fit for the commerce
of the world than others who have lacked this training.
And the further question remains whether the
games are worth their costly candle. That they
occupy a good deal of time at school and at college
is not necessarily an evil, seeing that the time left
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
for lessons or study is sufficient if well spent.
The real drawback incident to the excessive
devotion games inspire in our days is that they
leave little room in the boy&rsquo;s or collegian&rsquo;s mind
either for interest in his studies or for the love
of nature. They fill his thoughts, they divert
his ambition into channels of no permanent value
to his mind or life; they continue to absorb his
interest and form a large part of his reading long
after he has left school or college. Nevertheless,
be these things as they may, the opinion
of a man so able and so experienced as Bowen
was, deserves to be recorded; and his success in
endearing himself to and guiding his boys was
doubtless partly due to the use he made of their
liking for games.</p>
<p>He was never married, so the school became
the sole devotion of his life, and he bequeathed to
it the bulk of his property, directing an area of
land which he had purchased on the top of the
Hill to be always kept as an open space for the
benefit of boys and masters.</p>
<p>It need hardly be said that he loved boys as
he loved teaching. He took them with him in
the holidays on walking tours. He kept up correspondence
with many of his pupils after they
left Harrow, and advised them as occasion rose.
To many of them he remained through life the
model whom they desired to imitate. But he
was very chary of the exercise of influence. &ldquo;A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span>
boy&rsquo;s character,&rdquo; he once wrote, &ldquo;grows like the
Temple of old, without sound of mallet and
trowel. What we can do is to arrange matters
so as to give Virtue her best chance. We can
make the right choice sometimes a little easier,
we can prevent tendencies from blossoming into
acts, and render pitfalls visible. How much indirectly
and unconsciously we can do, none but
the recording angel knows. &lsquo;You can and you
should,&rsquo; said Chiffers,<a name='FNanchor_0047' id='FNanchor_0047'></a><a href='#Footnote_0047' class='fnanchor'>[56]</a> &lsquo;go straight to the heart of
every individual boy.&rsquo; Well, a fellow-creature&rsquo;s
mind is a sacred thing. You may enter into that
arcanum once a year, shoeless. And in the effort
to control the spirit of a pupil, to make one&rsquo;s own
approval his test and mould him by the stress of
our own presence, in the ambition to do this, the
craving for moral power and visible guiding, the
subtle pride of effective agency, lie some of the
chief temptations of a schoolmaster&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such ways and methods as I have endeavoured
to describe are less easy to imitate than those
which belong to the Arnoldine type of schoolmaster.
In Bowen&rsquo;s gaiety, in his vivacity, in the
humour which interpenetrated everything he said
or did, there was something individual. Teachers
who do not possess a like vivacity, versatility, and
humour cannot hope to apply with like success
the method of familiarity and sympathy. Not
indeed that Bowen stood altogether alone in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
use of that method. There were others among
his contemporaries who shared his view, and whose
practice was not dissimilar. He was, however, the
earliest and most brilliant exponent of the view,
so his career may be said to open a new line, and
to mark a new departure in the teacher&rsquo;s art.</p>
<p>I have mentioned his walking tours. He
was a pedestrian of extraordinary force, rather
tall, but spare and light, swift of foot, and tireless
in his activity. As an undergraduate he
had walked from Cambridge to Oxford, nearly
ninety miles, in twenty-four hours, scarcely halting.
At one time or another he had traversed
on foot all the coast-line and great part of the
inland regions of England. He was an accomplished
Alpine climber. His passion for exercise
of body as well as of mind was so salient a
feature in his character that his friends wondered
how he would be able to support old age. He
was spared the trial, for he was gay and joyous as
ever on the last morning of his life, and he died
in a moment, while mounting his bicycle after a
long ascent, among the lonely forests of Burgundy,
then bursting into leaf under an April sun.</p>
<p>His interest in politics provided him with
a short and strenuous interlude of public action,
which varied the even tenor of his life at Harrow.
At the general election of 1880 he stood as a
candidate for the little borough of Hertford (which
has since been merged in the county) against
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
Mr. Arthur Balfour, now (1902) First Lord of the
Treasury in England. The pro-Turkish policy
of Lord Beaconsfield, followed by the Afghan
War of 1878, had roused many Liberals who
usually took little part in political action. Bowen
felt the impulse to denounce the conduct of the
Ministry, and went into the contest with his usual
airy suddenness. He had little prospect of success
at such a place, for, like many of the so-called
Academic Liberals of those days, he made the
mistake of standing for a small semi-rural constituency,
overshadowed by a neighbouring magnate,
instead of for a large town, where both his
opinions and his oratory would have been better
appreciated. However, he enjoyed the contest
thoroughly, amusing himself as well as the electors
by his lively and sometimes impassioned speeches,
and he looked back to it as a pleasant episode in
his usually smooth and placid life. He was all his
life a strong Liberal <i>vieille roche</i>, a lover of freedom
and equality as well as of economy in public
finance, a Free Trader, an individualist, an enemy
of all wars and all aggressions, and in later years
growingly indignant at the rapid increase of
military and naval expenditure. He was also,
like the Liberals of 1850-60 in general, a sympathiser
with oppressed nationalities, though this
feeling did not carry him the length of accepting
the policy of Home Rule for Ireland, as
to which he had grave doubts, yet doubts not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
quite so serious as to involve his separation from
the Liberal party. Twice after 1880 he was on
the point of becoming a candidate for a seat in
the House of Commons, but whether his love for
Harrow would have suffered him to remain in
Parliament had he entered it may be doubted. One
could not even tell whether he was really disappointed
that his political aspirations remained unfulfilled.
Had he given himself to parliamentary life,
his readiness, ingenuity, and wit would have soon
made him valued by his own side, while his sincerity
and engaging manners would have commended
him to both sides alike. His delivery was always
too rapid, and his voice not powerful, yet these
defects would have been forgotten in the interest
which so peculiar a figure must have aroused.</p>
<p>His peace principles contrasted oddly with
his passion for military history, a passion which
prompted many vacation journeys to battlefields
all over Europe, from Salamanca to Austerlitz.
He had followed the campaigns of Napoleon
through Piedmont and Lombardy, through Germany
and Austria, as well as those of Wellington
in Spain and Southern France.<a name='FNanchor_0048' id='FNanchor_0048'></a><a href='#Footnote_0048' class='fnanchor'>[57]</a> This taste is
not uncommon in men of peace. Freeman had
it; J. R. Green and S. R. Gardiner had it; and
the historical works of Sir George Trevelyan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span>
and Dr. Thomas Hodgkin prove that it lives in
those genial breasts also. It was a pleasure to
be led over a battlefield by Bowen, for he had
a good eye for ground, he knew the movements
of the armies down to the smallest detail, and he
could explain with perfect lucidity the positions of
the combatants and the tactical moves in the game.</p>
<p>Twice only did he come across actual fighting,
once at D&uuml;ppel in 1864, during the Schleswig-Holstein
war, and again in Paris during the siege
of the Communards by the forces that obeyed
Thiers and the Assembly sitting at Versailles.
He maintained that the Commune had been unfairly
judged by Englishmen, and wrote a singularly
interesting description of what he saw while
risking his life in the beleaguered city. There
was in him a great spirit of adventure, though the
circumstances of his life gave it little scope.</p>
<p>Travel was one of his chief pleasures, but it
was, if possible, a still greater pleasure to his
fellow-travellers, for he was the most agreeable
of companions, fertile in suggestion, candid in
discussion, swift in decision. He cared nothing
for luxury and very little for comfort; he was
absolutely unselfish and imperturbably good-humoured;
he could get enjoyment out of the
smallest incidents of travel, and his curiosity to
see the surface of the earth as well as the cities
of men was inexhaustible. He loved the unexpected,
and if one had written proposing an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
expedition to explore Tibet, he would have
telegraphed back, &ldquo;Start to-night: do we meet
Charing Cross or Victoria?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have dwelt on Bowen&rsquo;s gifts and methods
as a teacher, because teaching was the joy and
the business of his life, and because he showed
a new way in which boys might be stimulated
and guided. But he was a great deal besides
a teacher, just as his brother Charles was a
great deal besides a lawyer. Both had talents
for literature of a very high order. Charles
published a verse translation of Virgil&rsquo;s <i>Eclogues</i>
and the first six books of the <i>&AElig;neid</i>, full of
ingenuity and refinement, as well as of fine poetic
taste. Edward&rsquo;s vein expressed itself in the
writing of songs. His school songs, composed
for the Harrow boys, became immensely popular
with them, and their use at school celebrations
of various kinds has passed from Harrow to
the other great schools of England, even
to some of the larger girls&rsquo; schools. The
songs are unique in their fanciful ingenuity and
humorous extravagance, full of a boyish joy in
life, in the exertion of physical strength, in the
mimic strife of games, yet with an occasional
touch of sadness, like the shadow of a passing
cloud as it falls on the cricket field over which
the shouts of the players are ringing. The metres
are various: all show rhythmical skill, and in all
the verse has a swing which makes it singularly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
effective when sung by a mass of voices. Most
of the songs are dedicated to cricket or football,
but a few are serious, and two or three of these
have a beauty of thought and perfection of form
which make the reader ask why a poetic gift so
true and so delicate should have been rarely used.
These songs were the work of his middle or later
years, and he never wrote except when the impulse
came upon him. The stream ran pure but
it ran seldom. In early days he had been for a
while, like many other brilliant young University
men of his time, a contributor to the <i>Saturday
Review</i>. (There surely never was a journal which
enlisted so much and such varied literary talent
as the <i>Saturday</i> did between 1855 and 1863.)
Bowen&rsquo;s articles were, like his elder brother&rsquo;s,
extremely witty. In later life he could seldom
be induced to write, having fallen out of the habit,
and being, indeed, too busy to carry on any large
piece of work; but the occasional papers on educational
subjects he produced showed no decline in
his vivacity or in the abundance of his humour.
Those who knew the range and the resources
of his mind sometimes regretted that he would do
nothing to let the world know them. But he
was, to a degree most unusual among men of real
power, absolutely indifferent, not only to fame, but
to opportunities for exercising power or influence.</p>
<p>The stoicism which he sought to form in his
pupils was inculcated by his own example. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span>
was a genial and cheerful stoicism, which checked
neither his affection for them nor his brightness
in society, and which permitted him to draw as
much enjoyment from small things as most
people can from great ones. But if he had
the gaiety of an Irishman, he had a double portion
of English reserve. He never gave expression
in words to his emotions. He never seemed
either elated or depressed. He never lost his
temper and never seemed to be curbing it. His
tastes and way of life were simple to the verge of
austerity; nor did he appear to desire anything
more than what he had obtained.</p>
<p>It is natural&mdash;possibly foolish, yet almost
inevitable&mdash;that those who perceive in a friend
the presence of rare and brilliant gifts should
desire that his gifts should not only be turned
to full account for the world&rsquo;s benefit, but
should become so known and appreciated as
to make others admire and value what they
admire and value. When such a man prefers to
live his life in his own way, and do the plain
duties that lie near him, with no thought of
anything further, they feel, though they may try
to repress, a kind of disappointment, as though
greatness or virtue had missed its mark because
known to few besides themselves. Yet there is
a sense in which that friend is most our own who
has least belonged to the world, who has least
cared for what the world has to offer, who has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span>
chosen the simplest and purest pleasures, who
has rendered the service that his way of life
required with no longing for any wider theatre
or any applause to be there won. Is there indeed
anything more beautiful than a life of quiet self-sufficing
yet beneficent serenity, such as the
ancient philosophers inculcated, a life which is
now more rarely than ever led by men of shining
gifts, because the inducements to bring such gifts
into the dusty thoroughfares of the world have
grown more numerous? Bowen had the best
equipment for a philosopher. He knew the things
that gave him pleasure, and sought no others. He
knew what he could do well. He followed his
own bent. His desires were few, and he could
gratify them all. He had made life exactly what
he wished it to be. Intensely as he enjoyed
travel, he never uttered a note of regret when the
beginning of a Harrow school term stopped a
journey at its most interesting point, so dearly
did he love his boys. What more can we desire
for our friends than this&mdash;that in remembering
them there should be nothing to regret, that all
who came under their influence should feel themselves
for ever thereafter the better for that influence,
that a happy and peaceful life should be
crowned by a sudden and painless death?</p>

<p>As with the progress of science new arts emerge
and new occupations and trades are created, so
with the progress of society professions previously
unknown arise, evolve new types of
intellectual excellence, and supply a new theatre
for the display of peculiar and exceptional gifts.
Such a profession, such a type, and the type
which is perhaps most specially characteristic of
our times, is that of the Editor. It scarcely
existed before the French Revolution, and is, as
now fully developed, a product of the last eighty
years. Various are its forms. There is the
Business Editor, who runs his newspaper as a
great commercial undertaking, and may neither
care for politics nor attach himself to any political
party. America still recollects the familiar
example set by James Gordon Bennett, the
founder of the <i>New York Herald</i>. There is
the Selective Editor, who may never pen a line,
but shows his skill in gathering an able staff
round him, and in allotting to each of them the
work he can do best. Such an one was John
Douglas Cook, a man of slender cultivation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
and few intellectual interests, but still remembered
in England by those who forty years
ago knew the staff of the <i>Saturday Review</i>,
then in its brilliant prime, as possessed of an
extraordinary instinct for the topics which caught
the public taste, and for the persons capable of
handling those topics. John T. Delane, of the
<i>Times</i>, had the same gift, with talents and
knowledge far surpassing Cook&rsquo;s. A third and
usually more interesting form is found in the
Editor who is himself an able writer, and who
imparts his own individuality to the journal he
directs. Such an one was Horace Greeley,
who, in the days before the War of Secession,
made the <i>New York Tribune</i> a power in
America. Such another, of finer natural quality,
was Michael Katkoff, who in his short career
did much to create and to develop the spirit
of nationality and imperialism in Russia thirty
years ago.</p>
<p>It was to this third form of the editorial profession
that Mr. Godkin belonged. He is the
most remarkable example of it that has appeared
in our time&mdash;perhaps, indeed, in any time since
the profession rose to importance; and all the
more remarkable because he was never, like
Greeley or Katkoff, the exponent of any widespread
sentiment or potent movement, but was
frequently in opposition to the feeling for the
moment dominant.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span></div>
<p>Edwin Lawrence Godkin, the son of a Protestant
clergyman and author, was born in the
county of Wicklow, in Ireland, in 1831. He
was educated at Queen&rsquo;s College, Belfast, read
for a short time for the English bar, but drifted
into journalism by accepting the post of correspondent
to the London <i>Daily News</i> during the
Crimean War in 1853-54. The horror of war which
he retained through his life was due to the glimpse
of it he had in the Crimea. Soon afterwards he
went to America, was admitted to the bar in New
York, but never practised, spent some months in
travelling through the Southern States on horseback,
learning thereby what slavery was, and
what its economic and social consequences, was
for two or three years a writer on the <i>New York
Times</i>, and ultimately, in 1865, established in
New York a weekly journal called the <i>Nation</i>.
This he continued to edit, writing most of it
himself, till 1881, when he accepted the editorship
of the <i>New York Evening Post</i>, an old and
respectable paper, but with no very large circulation.
The <i>Nation</i> continued to appear, but became
practically a weekly edition of the <i>Evening
Post</i>, or rather, as some one said, the <i>Evening
Post</i> became a daily edition of the <i>Nation</i>, for
the tone and spirit that had characterised the
<i>Nation</i> now pervaded the <i>Post</i>. In 1900 failing
health compelled him to retire from active work,
and in May 1902 he died in England. Journalism
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span>
left him little leisure for any other kind of literary
production; but he wrote in early life a short
history of Hungary; and a number of articles
which he had in later years contributed to the
<i>Nation</i> or to magazines were collected and published
in three volumes between 1895 and 1900.
They are clear and wise articles, specially instructive
where they deal with the most recent
aspects of democracy. But as they convey a less
than adequate impression of the peculiar qualities
which established his fame, I pass on to the work
by which he will be remembered, his work as a
weekly and daily public writer.</p>
<p>He was well equipped for this career by
considerable experience of the world, by large
reading, for though not a learned man, he had
assimilated a great deal of knowledge on economical
and historical subjects, and by a stock
of positive principles which he saw clearly and
held coherently. In philosophy and economics
he was a Utilitarian of the school of J. S.
Mill, and in politics what used to be called a
philosophical Radical, a Radical of the less
extreme type, free from sentiment and from
prejudices, but equally free from any desire to
destroy for the sake of destroying. Like the
other Utilitarians of those days, he was a
moderate optimist, expecting the world to grow
better steadily, though not swiftly; and he went
to America in the belief that he should there find
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
more progress secured, and more of further progress
in prospect, than any European country
could show. It was the land of promise, in
which all the forces making for good on which
the school of Mill relied were to be found at
work, hampered only by the presence of slavery.
I note this fact, because it shows that the pessimism
of Mr. Godkin&rsquo;s later years was not due to a
naturally querulous or despondent temperament.</p>
<p>So too was his mind admirably fitted for the
career he had chosen. It was logical, penetrating,
systematic, yet it was also quick and
nimble. His views were definite, not to say
dogmatic, and as they were confidently held,
so too they were confidently expressed. He
never struck a doubtful note. He never slurred
over a difficulty, nor sought, when he knew
himself ignorant, to cover up his ignorance.
Imagination was kept well in hand, for his constant
aim was to get at and deal with the vital
facts of every case. If he was not original in the
way of thinking out doctrines distinctively his
own, nor in respect of any exuberance of ideas
bubbling up in the course of discussion, there was
fertility as well as freshness in his application of
principles to current questions, and in the illustrations
by which he enforced his arguments.</p>
<p>As his thinking was exact, so his style was
clear-cut and trenchant. Even when he was
writing most swiftly, it never sank below a high
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span>
level of form and finish. Every word had its
use and every sentence told. There was no
doubt about his meaning, and just as little about
the strength of his convictions. He had a gift
for terse vivacious paragraphs commenting on
some event of the day or summing up the effect of
a speech or a debate. The touch was equally
light and firm. But if the manner was brisk, the
matter was solid: you admired the keenness of
the insight and the weight of the judgment just
as much as the brightness of the style. Much
of the brightness lay in the humour. That is a
plant which blossoms so much more profusely on
Transatlantic soil that English readers of the
<i>Nation</i> had usually a start of surprise when told
that this most humorous of American journalists
was not an American at all but a European,
and indeed a European who never became
thoroughly Americanised. It was humour of
a pungent and sarcastic quality, usually directed
to the detection of tricks or the exposure of
shams, but it was eminently mirth-provoking and
never malicious. Frequently it was ironical, and
the irony sometimes so fine as to be mistaken
for seriousness.</p>
<p>The <i>Nation</i> was from its very first numbers
so full of force, keenness, and knowledge, and so
unusually well written, that it made its way rapidly
among the educated classes of the Eastern States.
It soon became a power, but a power of a new
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
kind. Mr. Godkin wanted most of the talents
or interests of the ordinary journalist. He
gave no thought to the organisation of the
paper as a business undertaking. He scarcely
heeded circulation, either when his livelihood
depended upon the <i>Nation</i> of which he was the
chief owner, or when he was associated with
others in the ownership of the <i>Evening Post</i>.
He refused to allow any news he disapproved,
including all scandal and all society gossip, to
appear. He was prepared at any moment to
incur unpopularity from his subscribers, or even
to offend one half of his advertisers. He took
no pains to get news before other journals, and
cared nothing for those &ldquo;beats&rdquo; and &ldquo;scoops&rdquo; in
which the soul of the normal newspaper man
finds a legitimate source of pride. He was not
there, he would have said, to please either advertisers
or subscribers, but to tell the American
people the truths they needed to hear, and if
those truths were distasteful, so much the more
needful was it to proclaim them. He was absolutely
independent not only of all personal but
of all party ties. A public man was never
either praised or suffered to escape censure because
he was a private acquaintance. He once
told me that the being obliged to censure those
with whom he stood in personal relations was
the least agreeable feature of his profession.
Whether an act was done by the Republicans
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
or by the Democrats made no difference to his
judgment, or to the severity with which his
judgment was expressed. His distrust of Mr.
James G. Blaine had led him to support Mr.
Cleveland at the election of 1884, and he continued
to give a general approval to the latter
statesman during both his presidential terms. But
when Mr. Cleveland&rsquo;s Venezuelan message with
its menaces to England appeared in December
1895, Mr. Godkin vehemently denounced it, as
indeed he had frequently before blamed particular
acts of the Cleveland administrations. He sometimes
voted for the Republicans, sometimes for
the Democrats, according to the merits of the
transitory issue or the particular candidate, but
after 1884 no one could have called him either a
Republican or a Democrat.</p>
<p>Independence of party is less rare among
American than among European newspapers;
but courage such as Godkin&rsquo;s is rare everywhere.
The editor of a century ago had in most
countries to fear press censorship, or the law of
political libel, or the frowns of the great. The
modern editor, delivered from these risks, is
exposed to the more insidious temptations of
financial influence, of social pressure, of the
fear of injuring the business interests of the
paper, which are now sometimes enormous.
Godkin&rsquo;s conscientiousness and pride made him
equally indifferent to influence and to threats. As
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
some one said, you might as well have tried to
frighten the east wind. Clear, prompt, and self-confident,
judging everything by a high standard
of honour and public spirit, he distributed censure
with no regard either to the official position
or to the party affiliations of politicians. The
&ldquo;Weekly Day of Judgment&rdquo; was the title
bestowed upon the <i>Nation</i> by Charles Dudley
Warner, who himself admired it. As Godkin
expected&mdash;or at least demanded&mdash;righteousness
from every one, he was more a terror to evildoers
than a praise to them that do well, and
the fact that, having no private ends to serve,
he thought only of truth and the public interest,
made him all the more stringent. Because
he was, and found it easy to be, fearless and independent,
he scarcely allowed enough for the
timidity of others, and sometimes chastised the
weak as sternly as the wicked. An editor who
smites all the self-seekers and all the time-servers
whom he thinks worth smiting, is sure to become
a target for many arrows. But as Godkin
was an equally caustic critic of the sentimental
vagaries or economic heresies of well-meaning
men or sections of opinion, he incurred hostility
from quarters where the desire for honest administration
and the purity of public life was hardly
less strong than in the pages of the <i>Nation</i> itself.
Though he took no personal part in politics, never
appeared on platforms nor in any way put himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span>
forward, his paper was so markedly himself that
people talked of it as him. It was not &ldquo;the
<i>Nation</i> says&rdquo; or &ldquo;the <i>Post</i> says,&rdquo; but &ldquo;Godkin
says.&rdquo; Even his foreign birth was charged
against him&mdash;a rare charge in a country so
tolerant and catholic as the United States, where
every office except that of President is open to
newcomers as freely as to the native born.</p>
<p>He was called &ldquo;un-American,&rdquo; and I have
heard men who admired and read the <i>Nation</i>
nevertheless complain that they did not want
&ldquo;to be taught by a European how to run this
Republic.&rdquo; True it is that he did not see things
or write about them quite as an American would
have done. But was this altogether a misfortune?
The Italian cities of the Middle Ages used to call
in a man of character and mark from some other
place and make him Podest&aacute; just because he stood
outside the family ties and the factions of the
city. Godkin&rsquo;s foreign education gave him detachment
and perspective. It never reduced his
ardour to see administration and public life in
America made worthy of the greatness of the
American people.</p>
<p>No journal could have maintained its circulation
and extended its influence in the face of so
much hostility except by commanding merits.
The merits of the <i>Nation</i> were incontestable.
It was the best weekly not only in America
but in the world. The editorials were models
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span>
of style. The book reviews, many of them
in earlier days also written by Godkin himself,
were finished in point of form, and, when not
his own, came from the ablest specialist hands
in the country. The &ldquo;current notes&rdquo; of progress
in such subjects as geography, natural history,
and arch&aelig;ology were instructive and accurate.
So it was that people had to read the <i>Nation</i>
whether they liked it or not. It could not be
ignored. It was a necessity even where it was a
terror.</p>
<p>Yet neither the force of his reasoning nor
the brilliance of his style would have secured
Godkin&rsquo;s influence but for two other elements of
strength he possessed. One was the universal
belief in his disinterestedness and sincerity.
He was often charged with prejudice or bitterness,
but never with any sinister motive; enemies
no less than friends respected him. The
other was his humour. An austere moralist
who is brimful of fun is rare in any country.
Relishing humour more than does any other
people, the Americans could not be seriously
angry with a man who gave them so abundant a
feast.</p>
<p>To trace the course he took in the politics of
the United States since 1860 would almost be
to outline the history of forty years, for there
was no great issue in the discussion of which
he did not bear a part. He was a strong
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span>
supporter of the Northern cause during the War
of Secession, and by his letters to the London
<i>Daily News</i> did something to enlighten English
readers. When the problems of reconstruction
emerged after the war, he suggested lines of
action more moderate than those followed by
the Republican leaders, and during many subsequent
years denounced the &ldquo;carpet-baggers,&rdquo; and
advocated the policy of restoring self-government
to the Southern States and withdrawing
Federal troops. Incensed at the corruption of
some of the men who surrounded President
Grant during his first term, he opposed Grant&rsquo;s
re-election, as did nearly all the reformers of
those days. By this time he had begun to attack
the &ldquo;spoils system,&rdquo; and to demand a reform of
the civil service, and he had also become engaged
in that campaign against the Tammany organisation
in New York City which he maintained
with unabated energy till the end of his editorial
career.<a name='FNanchor_0049' id='FNanchor_0049'></a><a href='#Footnote_0049' class='fnanchor'>[58]</a> In 1884 he led the opposition to the
candidacy of Mr. Blaine for President, and it was
mainly the persistency with which the <i>Evening
Post</i> set forth the accusations brought against
that statesman that secured his defeat in New
York State, and therewith his defeat in the
election. It was on this occasion that the nickname
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span>
of Mugwump<a name='FNanchor_0050' id='FNanchor_0050'></a><a href='#Footnote_0050' class='fnanchor'>[59]</a> was first applied to Mr.
Godkin by the ablest of his antagonists in the
press, Mr. Dana of the <i>New York Sun</i>, a title
before long extended to the Independents whom
the <i>Post</i> led, and who constituted, during the
next ten or twelve years, a section of opinion
important, if not by its numbers, yet by the
intellectual and moral weight of the men who
composed it. When currency questions became
prominent, Mr. Godkin was a strong opponent
of bimetallism and of &ldquo;silverism&rdquo; in all its
forms, and a not less strenuous opponent of all
socialistic theories and movements. It need
hardly be added that he had always been an
upholder of the principles of Free Trade. Like
a sound Cobdenite, he was an advocate of
peace, and disliked territorial extension. He
opposed President Grant&rsquo;s scheme for the acquisition
of San Domingo, as he afterwards opposed
the annexation of Hawaii. His close study of
Irish history, and his old faith in the principle of
nationality, had made him a strenuous advocate of
Home Rule for Ireland. But no one was farther
than he from sharing the feelings of the American
Irish towards England. He condemned the
threats addressed in 1895 to Great Britain over
the Venezuela question; and glad as he was to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span>
see that question settled by England&rsquo;s acceptance
of an arbitration which she had previously
denied the right of the United States to
demand, he held that England must beware of
yielding too readily to pressure from the United
States, because such compliance would encourage
that aggressive spirit in the latter whose consequences
for both countries he feared. Never,
perhaps, did he incur so much obloquy as in
defending, almost single-handed, the British position
in the Venezuelan affair. The attacks made
all over the country on the <i>Evening Post</i> were,
he used to say, like storms of hail lashing against
his windows. At the very end of his career, he
resisted the war with Spain and the annexation
of the Philippine Islands, deeming the acquisition
of trans-Oceanic territories, inhabited by
inferior races, a dangerous new departure, opposed
to the traditions of the Fathers of the Republic,
and inconsistent with the principles on which the
Republic was founded. No public writer has left
a more consistent record.</p>
<p>In private life Mr. Godkin was a faithful
friend and a charming companion, genial as well
as witty, considerate of others, and liked no less
than admired by his staff on the <i>Evening Post</i>,
free from cynicism, and more indulgent in his
views of human nature than might have been
gathered from his public utterances. He never
despaired of democratic government, yet his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span>
spirits had been damped by the faint fulfilment
of those hopes for the progress of free nations,
and especially of the United States, which
had illumined his youth. The slow advance
of economic truths, the evils produced by
the increase of wealth, the growth of what he
called &ldquo;chromo-civilisation,&rdquo; the indifference of
the rich and educated to politics, the want of
nerve among politicians, the excitability of the
masses, the tenacity with which corruption and
misgovernment held their ground, in spite of
repeated exposures, in cities like New York,
Philadelphia, and Chicago&mdash;all these things had
so sunk into his soul that it became hard to induce
him to look at the other side, and to appreciate
the splendid recuperative forces which are
at work in America. Thus his friends were
driven to that melancholy form of comfort which
consists in pointing out that other countries are
no better. They argued that England in particular,
to which he had continued to look as the
home of political morality and enlightened State
wisdom, was suffering from evils, not indeed the
same as those which in his judgment afflicted
America, but equally serious. They bade him
remember that moral progress is not continuous,
but subject to ebbs of reaction, and that America
is a country of which one should never despair,
because in it evils have often before worked out
their cure. He did regretfully own, after his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span>
latest visits to Europe, that England had sadly
declined from the England of his earlier days,
and he admitted that the clouds under which his
own path had latterly lain might after a time be
scattered by a burst of sunshine; but his hopes for
the near future of America were not brightened by
these reflections. Sometimes he seemed to feel&mdash;though
of his own work he never spoke&mdash;as
though he had laboured in vain for forty years.</p>
<p>If he so thought, he did his work far less than
justice. It had told powerfully upon the United
States, and that in more than one way. Though
the circulation of the <i>Nation</i> was never large, it
was read by the two classes which in America have
most to do with forming political and economic
opinion&mdash;I mean editors and University teachers.
(The Universities and Colleges, be it remembered,
are far more numerous, relatively to the population,
in America than in England, and a more
important factor in the thought of the country.)
From the editors and the professors Mr. Godkin&rsquo;s
views filtered down into the educated class generally,
and affected its opinion. He instructed and
stimulated the men who instructed and stimulated
the rest of the people. To those young men
in particular who thought about public affairs and
were preparing themselves to serve their country,
his articles were an inspiration. The great hope
for American democracy to-day lies in the growing
zeal and the ripened intelligence with which the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span>
generation now come to manhood has begun to
throw itself into public work. Many influences
have contributed to this result, and Mr. Godkin&rsquo;s
has been among the most potent.</p>
<p>Nor was his example less beneficial to the
profession of journalism. There has always
been a profusion of talent in the American press,
talent more alert and versatile than is to be found
in the press of any European country. But in
1865 there were three things which the United
States lacked. Literary criticism did not maintain
a high standard, nor duly distinguish thorough from
flashy or superficial performances. Party spirit was
so strong and so pervasive that journalists were
content to denounce or to extol, and seldom subjected
the character of men or measures to a
searching and impartial examination. There was
too much sentimentalism in politics, with too little
reference of current questions to underlying principles,
too little effort to get down to what Americans
call the &ldquo;hard pan&rdquo; of facts. In all these
respects the last forty years have witnessed prodigious
advances; and, so far as the press is
concerned&mdash;for much has been due to the Universities
and to the growth of a literary class&mdash;Mr.
Godkin&rsquo;s writings largely contributed to the
progress made. His finished criticism, his exact
method, his incisive handling of economic problems,
his complete detachment from party, helped
to form a new school of journalists, as the example
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span>
he set of a serious and lofty conception of an editor&rsquo;s
duties helped to add dignity to the position. He
had not that disposition to enthrone the press
which made a great English newspaper once claim
for itself that it discharged in the modern world the
functions of the medi&aelig;val Church. But he brought
to his work as an anonymous writer a sense of responsibility
and a zeal for the welfare of his country
which no minister of State could have surpassed.</p>
<p>His friends may sometimes have wished that
he had more fully recognised the worth of sentiment
as a motive power in politics, that he had
more frequently tried to persuade as well as to convince,
that he had given more credit for partial
instalments of honest service and for a virtue less
than perfect, that he had dealt more leniently
with the faults of the good and the follies of the
wise. Defects in these respects were the almost
inevitable defects of his admirable qualities, of
his passion for truth, his hatred of wrong and
injustice, his clear vision, his indomitable spirit.</p>
<p>The lesson of his editorial career is a lesson
not for America only. Among the dangers that
beset democratic communities, none are greater
than the efforts of wealth to control, not only
electors and legislators, but also the organs of
public opinion, and the disposition of statesmen
and journalists to defer to and flatter the majority,
adopting the sentiment dominant at the moment,
and telling the people that its voice is the voice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span>
of God. Mr. Godkin was not only inaccessible
to the lures of wealth&mdash;the same may happily be
still said of many of his craft-brethren&mdash;he was
just as little accessible to the fear of popular
displeasure. Nothing more incensed him than
to see a statesman or an editor with his &ldquo;ear to
the ground&rdquo; (to use an American phrase), seeking
to catch the sound of the coming crowd. To
him, the less popular a view was, so much the
more did it need to be well weighed and, if
approved, to be strenuously and incessantly
preached. Democracies will always have demagogues
ready to feed their vanity and stir their
passions and exaggerate the feeling of the
moment. What they need is men who will swim
against the stream, will tell them their faults, will
urge an argument all the more forcibly because it
is unwelcome. Such an one was Edwin Godkin.
Since the death of Abraham Lincoln, America
has been generally more influenced by her writers,
preachers, and thinkers than by her statesmen.
In the list of those who have during the last forty
years influenced her for good and helped by their
pens to make her history, a list illustrated by such
names as those of R. W. Emerson and Phillips
Brooks and James Russell Lowell, his name
will find its place and receive its well-earned
meed of honour.</p>

<a name='LORD_ACTON' id='LORD_ACTON'></a>
<h2>LORD ACTON</h2>
</div>
<p>When Lord Acton died on 19th June 1902, at
Tegern See in Bavaria, England lost the most truly
cosmopolitan of her children, and Europe lost one
who was, by universal consent, in the foremost rank
of her men of learning. He belonged to an old
Roman Catholic family of Shropshire, a branch
of which had gone to Southern Italy, where his
grandfather, General Acton, had been chief
minister of the King of Naples in the great
war, at the time when the Bourbon dynasty
maintained itself in Sicily by the help of
the British fleet, while all Italy lay under the
heel of Napoleon. His father, Sir Ferdinand
Acton, married a German lady, heiress of the
ancient and famous house of Dalberg, one of the
great families of the middle Rhineland; so John
Edward Emerich Dalberg-Acton was born half a
German, and connected by blood with the highest
aristocracy of Germany. He was educated at
Oscott, one of the two chief Roman Catholic
colleges of England, under Dr. Wiseman, afterwards
Archbishop of Westminster and Cardinal;
but the most powerful influence on the development
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383' name='page_383'></a>383</span>
of his mind and principles came from
that glory of Catholic learning, a beautiful
soul as well as a capacious intellect, Dr. von
D&ouml;llinger, with whom Acton studied during some
years at Munich. He sat for a short time in
the House of Commons as member for Carlow
(1859); and was afterwards elected for Bridgnorth
(1865), but lost his seat (which he had
gained by one vote only) on a scrutiny. In
those days it was not easy for a Roman Catholic
to find an English constituency, so in 1869 Mr.
Gladstone procured his elevation to the peerage.
He made a successful speech in the House
of Lords in 1893, but took no prominent part in
parliamentary life in either House, feeling himself
too much of a student, and looking at current
questions from a point of view unlike that of
English politicians. Neither as a philosopher,
nor as a historian, nor as a product of German
training, could he find either Lords or Commons
a congenial audience. When he was asked soon
after he entered Parliament why he did not speak,
he answered that he agreed with nobody and nobody
agreed with him. But since he regarded politics as
history in the course of making under his eyes, he
continued to be all his life keenly interested in
public affairs, watching and judging every move
in the game. Mr. Gladstone, whose trusted
friend he had been for many years, was believed
to have on one occasion wished to place him in an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384' name='page_384'></a>384</span>
important office; but political exigencies made
this impossible, and the only public post he ever
held was that of Lord-in-Waiting in the Ministry
of 1892. In this capacity he was brought into
frequent contact with Queen Victoria, who felt
the warmest respect and admiration for him. He
was one of the very few persons surrounding her
who was familiar with most of the courts of Continental
Europe, and could discuss with her from
direct knowledge the men who figured in those
courts. At Windsor he spent in the library of
the Castle all the time during which he was not
required to be in actual attendance on the Queen,
a singular phenomenon among Lords-in-Waiting.</p>
<p>Unlike most English Roman Catholics, he was
a strong Liberal, a Liberal of that orthodox type,
individualist, free-trade, and peace-loving, which
prevailed from 1846 till 1885. He was also a
convinced Home Ruler, and had, indeed, adopted
the principle of Home Rule for Ireland long
before Mr. Gladstone himself was converted to it.
His faith in that principle rested on the value he
attached to self-government as a means of training
and developing the political aptitudes of a
people, and to the recognition of national sentiment,
which he held to be, like other natural forces,
useful when guided but formidable when repressed.
So too his Liberalism was based on the love of
freedom for its own sake, joined to the conviction
that freedom is the best foundation for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_385' name='page_385'></a>385</span>
stability of a constitution and the happiness of
a people. Reliance on the power of freedom
was, he used to say, one of the broadest of all the
lessons he had learned from history. He applied
it in ecclesiastical as well as in political affairs.
At the time of the Vatican Council of 1870 he
was, though a layman, prominent among those
who constituted the opposition maintained by the
Liberal section of the Roman Catholic Church
to the affirmation of the dogma of papal infallibility.
His full and accurate knowledge of ecclesiastical
history was placed at the disposal of the
prelates, such as Archbishop Dupanloup, Bishop
Strossmayer, and Archbishop Conolly (of Halifax,
Nova Scotia), who combated the Ultramontane
party in the animated and protracted debates
which illumined that &OElig;cumenical Council. One,
at least, of the treatises, and many of the letters
in the press which the Council called forth were
written either by him or from materials which he
supplied, and he was recognised by the Ultramontanes,
and in particular by Archbishop Manning,
as being, along with D&ouml;llinger, the most
formidable of their opponents behind the scenes.
As every one knows, the Infallibilists triumphed,
and the schism which led to the formation of the
Old Catholic Church in Germany and Switzerland
was the result. D&ouml;llinger was excommunicated;
but against Lord Acton no action was
taken, and he remained all his life a faithful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386' name='page_386'></a>386</span>
member of the Roman communion, while adhering
to the views he had advocated in 1870.</p>
<p>With this close hold upon practical life and
this constant interest in the politics of the world,
especially of England and the United States, no
one could be less like that cloistered student who
is commonly taken as the typical man of learning.
But Lord Acton was a miracle of learning. Of
the sciences of nature and their practical applications
in the arts he had indeed no more knowledge
than any cultivated man of the world is
expected to possess. But of all the so-called
&ldquo;human subjects&rdquo; his mastery was unequalled.
Learning was the business of his life. He was
gifted with a singularly tenacious memory. His
industry was untiring. Wherever he was&mdash;in
London, at Cannes in winter, at Tegern See in
summer, at Windsor or Osborne with the Queen,
latterly (till his health failed) at Cambridge during
the University terms&mdash;he never worked less
than eight hours a day. Yet, even after making
every allowance for his memory and his industry,
his friends stood amazed at the range and exactness
of his knowledge. It was as various as it was
profound, and much of it bore on recondite matters
which few men study to-day. Though less minute
where it touched the ancient and the early medi&aelig;val
world than as respected more recent times,
it might be said to cover the whole field of history,
both civil and ecclesiastical, and became wonderfully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387' name='page_387'></a>387</span>
full and exact when it reached the Renaissance and
Reformation periods. It included not only the
older theology, but modern Biblical criticism. It
included metaphysics; and not only metaphysics in
the more special sense, but the abstract side of
economics and that philosophy of law on which
the Germans set so much store. Most of the
prominent figures who have during the last
half-century led the march of inquiry in these
subjects, men like Ranke and Fustel de
Coulanges in history, Wilhelm Roscher in
economic science, Adolf Harnack in theology,
were his personal friends, and he could meet
them as an equal on their own ground. On
one occasion I had invited to meet him at dinner
the late Dr. (afterwards Bishop) Creighton, who
was then writing his <i>History of the Popes</i>, and the
late Professor Robertson Smith, the most eminent
Hebrew and Arabic scholar in Britain. The conversation
turned first upon the times of Pope Leo
the Tenth, and then upon recent controversies
regarding the dates of the books of the Old
Testament, and it soon appeared that Lord
Acton knew as much about the former as Dr.
Creighton, and as much about the latter as
Robertson Smith. The constitutional history of
the United States is a topic far removed from
those philosophical and ecclesiastical or theological
lines of inquiry to which most of his time had
been given; yet he knew it more thoroughly than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_388' name='page_388'></a>388</span>
any other living European, at least in England
and France, for of the Germans I will not venture
to speak, and he continued to read most of the
books of importance dealing with it which from
time to time were published. So, indeed, he
kept abreast of nearly all the literature of possible
utility bearing on history (especially ecclesiastical
history) and political theory that appeared in
Europe or America, reading much which his less
diligent or less eager friends thought scarcely
worthy of his perusal. And it need hardly be
said that his friends found him an invaluable guide
to the literature of any subject. In the sphere
of history more especially, one might safely
assume that a book which he did not know was
not worth knowing, while he was often able to
indicate, as being the right book to consult, some
work of which the person who consulted him,
albeit not unversed in the subject, had never
heard. He had at one time four libraries, the
largest at his family seat, Aldenham in Shropshire,
others at Tegern See, at Cannes, and in
London; and he could usually tell in which of
these the particular book he named was to be
found. Unlike most men who value their
libraries, he was fond of lending books, and
would sometimes put a friend to shame by asking
some weeks afterwards what the latter thought
of the volumes he had almost forced on the
borrower, and which the borrower had not found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_389' name='page_389'></a>389</span>
time to read. After saying this, I need scarcely
add that he was not a book collector in the usual
sense of the word. He did not care for rare
editions, and still less did he care about bindings.</p>
<p>His Aldenham library was itself a monument
of learning and industry.<a name='FNanchor_0051' id='FNanchor_0051'></a><a href='#Footnote_0051' class='fnanchor'>[60]</a> In forming it he sought
to bring together the books needed for tracing
and elucidating the growth of formative ideas
and of institutions in the sphere of ecclesiastical
and civil polity, and to attain this he made it
include not only all the best treatises handling
these large and complex subjects, but a mass of
original records bearing as well on the local
histories of the cities and provinces of such
countries as Italy and France as on the general
history of the great European States and of the
Church. This magnificent design he accomplished
by his own efforts before he was forty. What was
still more surprising, he had found time to use the
books. Nearly all of them show by notes pencilled
or marks placed in them that he had read some
part of them, and knew (so far as was needed for
his purpose) their contents.</p>
<p>Vast as his stores of knowledge were, they
were opened only to his few intimate friends.
It was not merely that he, as Tennyson said of
Edmund Lushington, &ldquo;bore all that weight of
learning lightly, like a flower.&rdquo; No one could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_390' name='page_390'></a>390</span>
have known in general society that he had any
weight of learning to bear. He seemed to be
merely a cultivated and agreeable man of the
world, interested in letters and politics, but disposed
rather to listen than to talk. He was
sometimes enigmatic and &ldquo;not incapable of casting
a pearl of irony in the way of those who would
mistake it for pebbly fact.&rdquo;<a name='FNanchor_0052' id='FNanchor_0052'></a><a href='#Footnote_0052' class='fnanchor'>[61]</a> A great capacity
for cynicism remained a capacity only, because
joined to a greater reverence for virtue. In a
large company he seldom put forth the fulness
of his powers; it was in familiar converse
with persons whose tastes resembled his own
that the extraordinary finesse and polish of his
mind revealed themselves. His critical taste was
not only delicate, but exacting; his judgments
leaned to the side of severity. No one applied
a more stringent moral standard to the conduct
of men in public affairs, whether to-day or in
past ages. He insisted upon this, in his inaugural
lecture at Cambridge, as the historian&rsquo;s first duty.
&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the office of historical science to
maintain morality as the sole impartial criterion
of men and things.&rdquo; When he came to estimate
the value of literary work he seemed no less
hard to satisfy. His ideal, both as respected
thoroughness in substance and finish in form,
was impossibly high, and he noted every failure
to reach it. No one appreciated merit more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_391' name='page_391'></a>391</span>
cordially. No one spoke with warmer admiration
of such distinguished historians and theologians
as the men whom I have just named. But the
precision of his thinking and the fastidiousness
of his taste gave more than a tinge of austerity
to his judgment. His opinions were peculiarly
instructive and illuminative to Englishmen, because
he was only half an Englishman in blood,
less than half an Englishman in his training and
mental habits. He was as much at home in Paris
or Berlin or Rome as he was in London, speaking
the four great languages with almost equal
facility, and knowing the men who in each of these
capitals were best worth knowing. He viewed
our insular literature and politics with the detachment
not only of a Roman Catholic among
Protestants, of a pupil of D&ouml;llinger and Roscher
among Oxford and Cambridge men, but also of
a citizen of the world, whose mastery of history
and philosophy had given him an unusually wide
outlook over mankind at large.</p>
<p>His interest in the great things, so far from
turning him away from the small things, seemed
to quicken his sense of their significance. It was
a noteworthy feature of his view of history that
he should have held that the explanation of most
of what has passed in the light is to be found in
what has passed in the dark. He was always
hunting for the key to secret chambers, preferring
to believe that the grand staircase is only for show,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_392' name='page_392'></a>392</span>
and meant to impose upon the multitude, while the
real action goes on in hidden passages behind. No
one knew so much of the gossip of the past; no
one was more intensely curious about the gossip
of the present, though in his hands it ceased
to be gossip and became unwritten history. One
was sometimes disposed to wonder whether he did
not think too much about the backstairs. But he
had seen a great deal of history in the making.</p>
<p>The passion for acquiring knowledge which
his German education had fostered ended by
becoming a snare to him, because it checked his
productive powers. Not that learning burdened
him, or clogged the soaring pinions of his mind.
He was master of all he knew. But acquisition
absorbed so much of his time that little was left
for literary composition. (D&ouml;llinger saw the
danger, for he observed that if Acton did not
write a great book before he reached the age
of forty, he would never do so.) It made him
think that he could not write on a subject till
he had read everything, or nearly everything,
that others had written about it. It developed
the habit of making extracts from the books he
read, a habit which took the form of accumulating
small slips of paper on which these
extracts were written in his exquisitely neat and
regular hand, the slips being arranged in cardboard
boxes according to their subjects. He
had hundreds of these boxes; and though much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_393' name='page_393'></a>393</span>
of their contents must no doubt be valuable, the
time spent in distilling and bottling the essence
of the books whence they came, might have been
better spent in giving to the world the ideas
which they had helped to evoke in his own mind.
If one may take the quotations appended to
his inaugural lecture as a sample of those he
had collected, many of them were not exceptionally
valuable, and did little more than show
how the same idea, perhaps no recondite one,
might be expressed in different words by different
persons. When one read some article he had
written, garnished and even overloaded with
citations, one often felt that his own part was
better, both in substance and in form, than the
passages which he had culled from his predecessors.
It becomes daily more than ever true
that the secret of historical composition is to
know what to neglect, since in our time it has
become impossible to exhaust the literature of
most subjects, and, as respects the last two
centuries, to exhaust even the original authorities.
Yet how shall one know what to neglect without
at least a glance of inspection? Acton was unwilling
to neglect anything; and his ardour for completeness
drew him into a policy fit only for one
who could expect to live three lives of mortal men.</p>
<p>The love of knowledge grew upon him till
it became a passion of the intellect, a thirst like
the thirst for water in a parching desert. What
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_394' name='page_394'></a>394</span>
he sought to know was not facts only, but facts
in their relations to principles, facts so disposed
and fitly joined together as to become the causeway
over which the road to truth shall pass.
For this purpose events were in his view not
more important than the thoughts of men, because
discursive and creative thought was to him the
ruling factor in history. Hence books must be
known&mdash;books of philosophic creation, books of
philosophic reflection, no less than those which
record what has happened. The danger of this
conception is that everything men have said or
written, as well as everything they have done,
becomes a possibly significant fact; and thus the
search for truth becomes endless because the
materials are inexhaustible.</p>
<p>He expressed in striking words, prefixed to
a list of books suggested for a young man&rsquo;s
perusal, his view of the aim of a course of
historical reading. It is &ldquo;to give force and
fulness and clearness and sincerity and independence
and elevation and generosity and serenity
to his mind, that he may know the method and
law of the process by which error is conquered
and truth is won, discerning knowledge from
probability and prejudice from belief, that he
may learn to master what he rejects as fully as
what he adopts, that he may understand the
origin as well as the strength and vitality of
systems and the better motive of men who are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_395' name='page_395'></a>395</span>
wrong ... and to steel him against the charm
of literary beauty and talent.&rdquo;<a name='FNanchor_0053' id='FNanchor_0053'></a><a href='#Footnote_0053' class='fnanchor'>[62]</a></p>
<p>Neither his passion for facts nor his appreciation
of style and form made him decline to the
right hand or to the left from the true position
of a historian. He set little store upon what is
called literary excellence, and would often reply,
when questioned as to the merits of some book
bearing an eminent name, &ldquo;You need not read
it: it adds nothing to what we knew.&rdquo; He valued
facts only so far as they went to establish a principle
or explained the course of events. It was really
not so much in the range of his knowledge as in
the profundity and precision of his thought that
his greatness lay.</p>
<p>His somewhat overstrained conscientiousness,
coupled with the practically unattainable ideal of
finish and form which he set before himself, made
him less and less disposed to literary production.
No man of first-rate powers has in our time left
so little by which posterity may judge those
powers. In his early life, when for a time he
edited the <i>Home and Foreign Review</i>, and when
he was connected with the <i>Rambler</i> and the
<i>North British Review</i>, he wrote frequently; and
even between 1868 and 1890 he contributed
to the press some few historical essays and a
number of anonymous letters. But the aversion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_396' name='page_396'></a>396</span>
to creative work seemed to grow on him. About
1890 he so far yielded to the urgency of a few
friends as to promise to reissue a number of his
essays in a volume, but, after rewriting and polishing
these essays during several years, he abandoned
the scheme altogether. In 1882 he had
already drawn out a plan for a comprehensive
history of Liberty. But this plan also he
dropped, because the more he read with a view
to undertaking it the more he wished to read,
and the vaster did the enterprise seem to loom up
before him. With him, as with many men who
cherish high literary ideals, the Better proved
to be the enemy of the Good.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, late at night, in his library
at Cannes, he expounded to me his view of how
such a history of Liberty might be written, and
in what wise it might be made the central thread
of all history. He spoke for six or seven minutes
only; but he spoke like a man inspired, seeming
as if, from some mountain summit high in air, he
saw beneath him the far-winding path of human
progress from dim Cimmerian shores of prehistoric
shadow into the fuller yet broken and
fitful light of the modern time. The eloquence
was splendid, but greater than the eloquence was
the penetrating vision which discerned through
all events and in all ages the play of those moral
forces, now creating, now destroying, always
transmuting, which had moulded and remoulded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_397' name='page_397'></a>397</span>
institutions, and had given to the human spirit
its ceaselessly-changing forms of energy. It was
as if the whole landscape of history had been
suddenly lit up by a burst of sunlight. I have
never heard from any other lips any discourse like
this, nor from his did I ever hear the like again.</p>
<p>His style suffered in his later days from
the abundance of the interspersed citations, and
from the overfulness and subtlety of the thought,
which occasionally led to obscurity. But when
he handled a topic in which learning was not
required, his style was clear, pointed and incisive,
sometimes epigrammatic. Several years ago he
wrote in a monthly magazine a short article upon
a biography of one of his contemporaries which
showed how admirable a master he was of polished
diction and penetrating analysis, and made one
wish that he had more frequently consented to
dash off light work in a quick unstudied way.</p>
<p>To the work of a University professor he came
too late to acquire the art of fluent and forcible
oral discourse, nor was the character of his mind,
with its striving after a flawless exactitude of
statement, altogether fitted for the function of
presenting broad summaries of facts to a youthful
audience. His predecessor in the Cambridge
chair of history, Sir John Seeley, with less knowledge,
less subtlety, and less originality, had in
larger measure the gift of oral exposition and
the power of putting points, whether by speech
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_398' name='page_398'></a>398</span>
or by writing, in a clear and telling way. No one,
indeed, since Macaulay has been a better point-putter
than Seeley was. But Acton&rsquo;s lectures
(read from MS.) were models of lucid and stately
narrative informed by fulness of thought; and
they were so delivered as to express the feeling
which each event had evoked in his own mind.
That sternness of character which revealed itself
in his judgments of men and books never affected
his relations to his pupils. Precious as his time
was, he gave it generously, encouraging them
to come to him for help and counsel. They
were awed by the majesty of his learning. Said
one of them to me, &ldquo;When Lord Acton answers
a question put to him, I feel as if I were looking
at a pyramid. I see the point of it clear
and sharp, but I see also the vast subjacent
mass of solid knowledge.&rdquo; They perceived,
moreover, that to him History and Philosophy
were not two things but one, and perceived that
of History as well as of divine Philosophy it may
be said that she too is &ldquo;charming, and musical as
is Apollo&rsquo;s lute.&rdquo; Thus the impression produced in
the University by the amplitude of Lord Acton&rsquo;s
views, by the range of his learning, by the liberality
of his spirit and his unfailing devotion to
truth and to truth alone, was deep and fruitful.</p>
<p>When they wished that he had given to the world
more of his wisdom, his friends did not undervalue
a life which was in itself a rare and exquisite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_399' name='page_399'></a>399</span>
product of favouring nature and unwearied diligence.
They only regretted that the influence of
his ideas, of his methods, and of his spirit, had
not been more widely diffused in an enduring
form. It was as when a plant unknown elsewhere
grows on some remote isle where ships seldom
touch. Few see the beauty of the flower, and
here death came before the seed could be gathered
to be scattered in receptive soil.</p>
<p>To most men Lord Acton seemed reserved as
well as remote, presenting a smooth and shining
surface beneath which it was hard to penetrate.
He avoided publicity and popularity with the
tranquil dignity of one for whom the world of
knowledge and speculation was more than sufficient.
But he was a loyal friend, affectionate to
his intimates, gracious in his manners, blameless
in all the relations of life. Comparatively few
of his countrymen knew his name, and those who
did thought of him chiefly as the confidant of Mr.
Gladstone, and as the most remarkable instance
of a sincere and steadfast Roman Catholic who
was a Liberal alike in politics and in theology.
But those who had been admitted to his friendship
recognised him as one of the finest intelligences
of his generation, an unsurpassed,
and indeed a scarcely rivalled, master of every
subject which he touched.</p>

<a name='WILLIAM_EWART_GLADSTONE' id='WILLIAM_EWART_GLADSTONE'></a>
<h2>WILLIAM EWART GLADSTONE</h2>
</div>
<p>Of no man who has lived in our times is it so
hard to speak in a concise and summary fashion
as of Mr. Gladstone. For fifty years he was so
closely associated with the public affairs of his
country that the record of his parliamentary life
is virtually an outline of English political history
during those years. His activity spread itself out
over many fields. He was the author of several
learned and thoughtful books, and of a multitude
of articles upon all sorts of subjects. He showed
himself as eagerly interested in matters of classical
scholarship and Christian doctrine and ecclesiastical
history as in questions of national finance
and foreign policy. No account of him could be
complete without reviewing his actions and
estimating the results of his work in all these
directions.</p>
<p>But the difficulty of describing and judging
him goes deeper. His was a singularly complex
nature, whose threads it was hard to unravel.
His individuality was extremely strong. All that
he said or did bore its impress. Yet it was an
individuality so far from being self-consistent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_401' name='page_401'></a>401</span>
as sometimes to seem a bundle of opposite
qualities capriciously united in a single person.
He might with equal truth have been called, and
he was in fact called, a conservative and a revolutionary.
He was dangerously impulsive, and had
frequently to suffer for his impulsiveness; yet
he was also not merely prudent and cautious,
but so astute as to have been accused of craft
and dissimulation. So great was his respect
for tradition that he clung to views regarding
the authorship of the Homeric poems and
the date of the books of the Old Testament
which nearly all competent specialists
have now rejected. So bold was he in practical
matters that he carried through sweeping
changes in the British constitution, changed the
course of English policy in the nearer East,
overthrew an established church in one part of
the United Kingdom, and committed himself
in principle to the overthrow of two other
established churches in other parts. He came
near to being a Roman Catholic in his religious
opinions, yet was for the last twenty years
of his life the trusted leader of the English
Protestant Nonconformists and the Scottish
Presbyterians. No one who knew him intimately
doubted his conscientious sincerity and earnestness,
yet four-fifths of the English upper classes
were in his later years wont to regard him as a
self-interested schemer who would sacrifice his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_402' name='page_402'></a>402</span>
country to his ambition. Though he loved
general principles, and often soared out of the
sight of his audience when discussing them, he
generally ended by deciding upon points of detail
the question at issue. He was at different times
of his life the defender and the assailant of the
same institutions, yet scarcely seemed inconsistent
in doing opposite things, because his
methods and his arguments preserved the same
type and colour throughout. Those who had
at the beginning of his career discerned in him
the capacity for such diversities and contradictions
would probably have predicted that they
must wreck it by making his purposes fluctuating
and his course erratic. Such a prediction might
have proved true of any one with less firmness of
will and less intensity of temper. It was the
persistent heat and vehemence of his character,
the sustained passion which he threw into the
pursuit of the object on which he was for the
moment bent, that fused these dissimilar qualities
and made them appear to contribute to and
increase the total force which he exerted.</p>
<p>The circumstances of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s political
career help to explain, or, at any rate, will furnish
occasion for the attempt to explain, this complexity
and variety of character. But before I
come to his manhood it is convenient to advert
to three conditions whose influence on him was
profound&mdash;the first his Scottish blood, the second
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_403' name='page_403'></a>403</span>
his Oxford education, the third his apprenticeship
to public life under Sir Robert Peel.</p>
<p>Theories of character based on race differences
are dangerous, because they are as hard to
test as they are easy to form. Still, we all
know that there are specific qualities and tendencies
usually found in the minds of men of
certain stocks, just as there are peculiarities in
their faces or in their speech. Mr. Gladstone
was born and brought up in Liverpool, and
always retained a touch of Lancashire accent.
But, as he was fond of saying, every drop of
blood in his veins was Scotch. His father&rsquo;s
family belonged to the Scottish Lowlands, and
came from the neighbourhood of Biggar, in the
Upper Ward of Lanarkshire, where the ruined
walls of Gledstanes<a name='FNanchor_0054' id='FNanchor_0054'></a><a href='#Footnote_0054' class='fnanchor'>[63]</a>&mdash;&ldquo;the kite&rsquo;s rock&rdquo;&mdash;may
still be seen. His mother was of Highland extraction,
by name Robertson, from Dingwall, in
Ross-shire. Thus he was not only a Scot, but a
Scot with a strong infusion of the Celtic element,
the element whence the Scotch derive most of
what distinguishes them from the northern English.
The Scot is more excitable, more easily
brought to a glow of passion, more apt to be
eagerly absorbed in one thing at a time. He
is also more fond of exerting his intellect on
abstractions. It is not merely that the taste for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_404' name='page_404'></a>404</span>
metaphysical theology is commoner in Scotland
than in England, but that the Scotch have a
stronger relish for general principles. They
like to set out by ascertaining and defining such
principles, and then to pursue a series of logical
deductions from them. They are, therefore,
bolder reasoners than the English, less content
to remain in the region of concrete facts, more
prone to throw themselves into the construction
of a body of speculative doctrine. The
Englishman is apt to plume himself on being
right in spite of logic; the Scotchman likes
to think that it is through logic he has reached
his results, and that he can by logic defend
them. These are qualities which Mr. Gladstone
drew from his Scottish blood. He had a keen
enjoyment of the processes of dialectic. He
loved to get hold of an abstract principle and to
derive all sorts of conclusions from it. He was
wont to begin the discussion of a question by
laying down two or three sweeping propositions
covering the subject as a whole, and would then
proceed to draw from these others which he
could apply to the particular matter in hand.
His well-stored memory and boundless ingenuity
made the discovery of such general propositions
so easy a task that a method in itself agreeable
sometimes appeared to be carried to excess. He
frequently arrived at conclusions which the judgment
of the common-sense auditor did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_405' name='page_405'></a>405</span>
approve, because, although they seemed to have
been legitimately deduced from the general
principles just enunciated, they were somehow
at variance with the plain teaching of the facts.
At such moments one felt that the man who
was fascinating but perplexing Englishmen by
his subtlety was not himself an Englishman
in mental quality, but had the love for abstractions
and refinements and dialectical analysis
which characterises the Scotch intellect. He
had also a large measure of that warmth and
vehemence, called in the sixteenth century the
<i>perfervidum ingenium Scotorum</i>, which belong to
the Scottish temperament, and particularly to the
Celtic Scot. He kindled quickly, and when
kindled, he shot forth a strong and brilliant flame.
To any one with less power of self-control such
intensity of emotion as he frequently showed
would have been dangerous; nor did this excitability
fail, even with him, to prompt words
and acts which a cooler judgment would have
disapproved. But it gave that spontaneity which
was one of the charms of his nature; it produced
that impression of profound earnestness and of
resistless force which raised him out of the rank
of ordinary statesmen. The rush of emotion
swelling fast and full seemed to turn the whole
stream of intellectual effort into whatever channel
lay at the moment nearest.</p>
<p>With these Scottish qualities, Mr. Gladstone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_406' name='page_406'></a>406</span>
was brought up at school and college (Eton and
Christ Church) among Englishmen, and received
at Oxford, then lately awakened from a long
torpor, a bias and tendency which never thereafter
ceased to affect him. The so-called
&ldquo;Oxford Movement,&rdquo; which afterwards obtained
the name of Tractarianism and carried Newman
and Manning, together with other less famous
leaders, on to Rome, had not yet, in 1831, when
Mr. Gladstone obtained his degree with double
first-class honours, taken visible shape, or
become, so to speak, conscious of its own purposes.
But its doctrinal views, its peculiar vein
of religious sentiment, its respect for antiquity
and tradition, its proneness to casuistry, its taste
for symbolism, were already in the air as influences
working on the more susceptible of the
younger minds. On Mr. Gladstone they told
with full force. He became, and never ceased
to be, not merely a High-churchman, but what
may be called an Anglo-Catholic, in his theology,
deferential not only to ecclesiastical tradition,
but to the living voice of the Visible Church,
revering the priesthood as the recipients (if
duly ordained) of a special grace and peculiar
powers, attaching great importance to the sacraments,
feeling himself nearer to the Church of
Rome, despite what he deemed her corruptions,
than to any of the non-Episcopal Protestant
churches. Henceforth his interests in life were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_407' name='page_407'></a>407</span>
as much ecclesiastical as political. For a time
he desired to be ordained a clergyman. Had
this wish, abandoned in deference to his father&rsquo;s
advice, been carried out, he must eventually have
become a leading figure in the Church of England
and have sensibly affected her recent history.
The later stages in his career drew him away
from the main current of political opinion within
that church. He who had been the strongest
advocate of the principle of the State establishment
of religion came to be the chief actor in
the disestablishment of the Protestant Episcopal
Church in Ireland, and a supporter of the policy
of disestablishment in Scotland and in Wales.
But the colour which these Oxford years gave
to his mind and thoughts was never effaced.
While they widened the range of his interests
and deepened his moral earnestness, they at the
same time confirmed his natural bent toward
over-subtle distinctions and fine-drawn reasonings,
and put him out of sympathy not only with the
attitude of the average Englishman, who is essentially
a Protestant&mdash;that is to say, averse to sacerdotalism,
and suspicious of any other religious
authority than that of the Bible and the individual
conscience&mdash;but also with two of the
strongest influences of our time, the influence
of the sciences of nature, and the influence of
historical criticism. Mr. Gladstone, though too
wise to rail at science, as many religious men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_408' name='page_408'></a>408</span>
did till within the last few years, could never
quite reconcile himself either to the conclusions
of geology and zoology regarding the history of
the physical world and the creatures which inhabit
it, or to modern methods of critical inquiry
as applied to Scripture and to ancient literature
generally. The training which Oxford then
gave, stimulating as it was, and free from the
modern error of over-specialisation, was defective
in omitting the experimental sciences, and in
laying undue stress upon the study of language.
A proneness to dwell on verbal distinctions and
to trust overmuch to the analysis of terms as a
means of reaching the truth of things is noticeable
in many eminent Oxford writers of that and
the next succeeding generation&mdash;some of them,
like the illustrious F. D. Maurice, far removed
from Cardinal Newman and Mr. Gladstone in
theological opinion.</p>
<p>When, bringing with him a brilliant University
reputation, he entered the House of Commons at
the age of twenty-three, Sir Robert Peel was
leading the Tory party with an authority and
ability rarely surpassed in the annals of parliament.
Within two years the young man was
admitted into the short-lived Tory ministry of
1834, and soon proved himself a promising
lieutenant of the experienced chief. Peel was an
eminently wary man, alive to the necessity of
watching the signs of the times, of studying and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_409' name='page_409'></a>409</span>
interpreting the changeful phases of public
opinion. Yet he always kept his own counsel.
Even when he perceived that the policy he
had hitherto followed would need to be modified,
Peel continued to use guarded language and did
not publicly commit himself to change till it
was plain that the fitting moment had arrived.
He was, moreover, a master of detail, slow to
propound a plan until he had seen how its outlines
were to be filled up by appropriate devices
for carrying it out in practice. These qualities
and habits of the minister profoundly affected
his disciple. They became part of the texture of
Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s political character, and in his
case, as in that of Peel, they sometimes brought
censure upon him, as having locked up too long
within his breast views or purposes which he
thought it unwise to disclose till effect could be
forthwith given to them. Such reserve, such a
guarded attitude and tenderness for existing
institutions, may have been not altogether natural
to Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s mind, but due partly to the
influence of Peel, partly to the tendency to
hold by tradition and the established order
which reverence for Christian antiquity and faith
in the dogmatic teachings of the Church had
planted deep in his soul. The contrast between
Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s caution and respect for facts on
the one hand, and his reforming fervour on the
other, like the contrast which ultimately appeared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_410' name='page_410'></a>410</span>
between his sacerdotal tendencies and his political
liberalism, contributed to make his character
perplexing and to expose his conduct to the
charge of inconsistency. Inconsistent, in the
proper sense of the word, he was not, much
less changeable. He was really, in his fundamental
convictions and the main habits of his
mind, one of the most tenacious and persistent
of men. But there were always at work in him
two tendencies. One was the speculative desire
to probe everything to the bottom, to try it
by the light of general principles and logic, and
when it failed to stand this test, to reject it.
The other was the sense of the complexity of
existing social and political arrangements, and of
the risk of disturbing any one part of them until
the time had arrived for resettling other parts
also. Every statesman feels both these sides to
every concrete question of reform. No one has
set them forth more cogently, and in particular
no one has more earnestly dwelt on the necessity
for the latter side, than the most profound
thinker among British statesmen, Edmund Burke.
When Mr. Gladstone stated either side with his
incomparable force, people forgot that there was
another side which would be no less vividly present
to him at some other moment. He was not only,
like all successful parliamentarians, necessarily
something of an opportunist, though perhaps less
so than his master, but was moved by emotion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_411' name='page_411'></a>411</span>
more than most statesmen, and certainly more
than Peel. The relative strength with which
the need for drastic reform or the need for watchful
conservatism, as the case might be, presented
itself to his mind depended largely upon the
weight which his emotions cast into one or
other scale, and this emotional element made it
difficult to forecast his course. Thus his action
in public life was the result of influences differing
widely in their origin, influences, moreover, which
could be duly appreciated only by those who knew
him intimately.</p>
<p>Whoever has followed his political career has
been struck by the sharp divergence of the views
entertained by his fellow-countrymen about one
who had been for so long a period under their
observation. That he was possessed of boundless
energy and brilliant eloquence all agreed.
But agreement went no further. One section of
the nation accused him of sophistry, of unwisdom,
of a want of patriotism, of a lust for power. The
other section not only repelled these charges,
but admired in him a conscientiousness and a
moral enthusiasm such as no political leader had
shown for centuries. When the qualities of his
mind and the aptitudes for politics which he
showed have been briefly examined, it will be
fitting to return to these divergent views of his
character, and endeavour to discover which of
them contains the larger measure of truth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_412' name='page_412'></a>412</span>
Meantime let it suffice to say that among the
reasons that led men to misjudge him, this union
in one person of opposite qualities was the chief.
He was rather two men than one. Passionate
and impulsive on the emotional side of his nature,
he was cautious and conservative on the intellectual.
Few understood the conjunction; still
fewer saw how much of what was perplexing in
his conduct it explained.</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone sat for sixty-three years (1833-1895)
in Parliament, was for twenty-eight years
(1866-1894) the leader of his party, and was four
times Prime Minister. He began as a high
Tory, remained about fifteen years in that camp,
was then led by the split between Peel and the
Protectionists to take up an intermediate position,
and finally was forced to cast in his lot with the
Liberals, for in England, as in America, third
parties seldom endure. No parliamentary career
in English annals is comparable to his for its
length and variety; and of those who saw its
close in the House of Commons, there was only
one man, Mr. Villiers (who died in January 1898),
who could remember its beginning. Mr. Gladstone
had been opposed in 1833 to men who might
have been his grandfathers; he was opposed in
1894 to men who might have been his grandchildren.
It is no part of my design to describe
or comment on the events of such a life. All that
can be done here is to indicate the more salient
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_413' name='page_413'></a>413</span>
characteristics which a study of his career as a
statesman and a parliamentarian sets before us.</p>
<p>The most remarkable of these characteristics
was the openness, freshness, and eagerness of
mind which he preserved down to the end of
his life. Most men form few new opinions
after thirty-five, just as they form few new
intimacies. Intellectual curiosity may remain
even after fifty, but its range narrows as a man
abandons the hope of attaining any thorough
knowledge of subjects other than those which
make the main business of his life. It is impossible
to follow the progress of all the new ideas
that are set afloat in the world, impossible to
be always examining the foundations of one&rsquo;s
political or religious beliefs. Repeated disappointments
and disillusionments make a man
expect less from changes the older he grows;
while indolence deters him from entering upon
new enterprises. None of these causes seemed
to affect Mr. Gladstone. He was as much
excited over a new book (such as Cardinal
Manning&rsquo;s Life) at eighty-four as when at
fourteen he insisted on compelling little Arthur
Stanley (afterwards Dean of Westminster, and
then aged nine) forthwith to procure and study
Gray&rsquo;s poems, which he had just perused himself.
His reading covered almost the whole field
of literature, except physical and mathematical
science. While frequently declaring that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_414' name='page_414'></a>414</span>
must confine his political thinking and leadership
to a few subjects, he was so observant
of current events that the course of talk
brought up scarcely any topic in which he did
not seem to know what was the latest thing that
had been said or done. Neither the lassitude
nor the prejudices that usually accompany old age
prevented him from giving a fair consideration to
any new doctrines. But though his intellect was
restlessly at work, and though his curiosity disposed
him to relish novelties, except in theology,
that bottom rock in his mind of caution and reserve,
which has already been referred to, made
him refuse to part with old views even when he
was beginning to accept new ones. He allowed
both to &ldquo;lie on the table&rdquo; together, and while
declaring himself open to conviction, felt it
safer to speak and act on the old lines till the
process of conviction had been completed. It
took fourteen years, from 1846 to 1860, to carry
him from the Conservative into the Liberal camp.
It took five stormy years to bring him round to
Irish Home Rule, though his mind was constantly
occupied with the subject from 1880 to 1885,
and those who watched him closely saw that
the process had advanced a long way even in
1882. And as regards ecclesiastical establishments,
having written a book in 1838 as a warm
advocate of State churches, it was not till 1867
that he adopted the policy of disestablishment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_415' name='page_415'></a>415</span>
for Ireland, not till 1890 that he declared himself
ready to apply that policy in Wales and Scotland
also.</p>
<p>Both these qualities&mdash;his disposition to revise
his opinions in the light of new arguments and
changing conditions, and the silence he maintained
till the process of revision had been
completed&mdash;exposed him to misconstruction.
Commonplace men, unwont to give serious
scrutiny to their opinions, ascribed his changes
to self-interest, or at best regarded them as the
index of an unstable purpose. Dull men could
not understand why he should have forborne to
set forth all that was passing in his mind, and saw
little difference between reticence and dishonesty.
In so far as they shook public confidence, these
characteristics injured him in his statesman&rsquo;s
work. Yet the loss was outweighed by the gain.
In a country where opinion is active and changeful,
where the economic conditions that legislation
has to deal with are in a state of perpetual flux,
where the balance of power between the upper,
the middle, and the poorer classes has been swiftly
altering during the last seventy years, no statesman
can continue to serve the public if he adheres
obstinately to the doctrines with which he started
in life. He must&mdash;unless, of course, he stands
aloof in permanent isolation&mdash;either subordinate
his own views to the general sentiment of his
party, and be driven to advocate courses he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_416' name='page_416'></a>416</span>
secretly mislikes, or else, holding himself ready
to quit his party, if need be, must be willing
to learn from events, and to reconsider his
opinions in the light of emergent tendencies
and insistent facts. Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s pride as
well as his conscience forbade the former alternative;
it was fortunate that the tireless activity
of his intellect made the latter natural to him.
He was accustomed to say that the capital fault
of his earlier days had been his failure adequately
to recognise the worth and power of liberty, and
the tendency which things have to work out for
good when left to themselves. The application
of this principle gave room for many developments,
and many developments there were. He
may have shown less than was needed of that
prescience which is, after integrity and courage,
the highest gift of a statesman, but which can
seldom be expected from an English minister,
too engrossed to find time for the patient reflection
from which alone sound forecasts can
issue. But he had the next best quality, that
of remaining accessible to new ideas and learning
from the events which passed under his eyes.</p>
<p>With this openness and flexibility of mind
there went a not less remarkable ingenuity
and resourcefulness. Fertile in expedients, he
was still more fertile in reasonings by which
to recommend the expedients. The gift had
its dangers, for he was apt to be carried away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_417' name='page_417'></a>417</span>
by the dexterity of his own dialectic, and to
think that a scheme must be sound in whose
support he could muster a formidable array
of arguments. He never seemed at a loss, in
public or in private, for a criticism, or for an
answer to the criticisms of others. If his power
of adapting his own mind to the minds of those
whom he had to convince had been equal to the
skill and swiftness with which he accumulated a
mass of matter persuasive to those who looked
at things in his own way, no one would have
exercised so complete a control over the political
opinion of his time. But his intellect
lacked this power of adaptation. It moved on
lines of its own, which were often misconceived,
even by those who sought to follow him loyally.
Thus, as already observed, he was blamed for
two opposite faults. Some, pointing to the fact
that he had frequently altered his views, denounced
him as a demagogue profuse of promises,
ready to propose whatever he thought
likely to catch the people&rsquo;s ear. Others complained
that there was no knowing where to
have him; that he had an erratic mind, whose
currents ran underground and came to the
surface in unexpected places; that he did not
consult his party, but followed his own impulses;
that his guidance was unsafe because
his decisions were unpredictable. Much of
the suspicion with which he was regarded,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_418' name='page_418'></a>418</span>
especially after 1885, arose from this view of
his character.</p>
<p>It was an unfair view, yet nearer to the truth
than that which charged him with seeking to flatter
and follow the people. No great popular leader
had in him less of the demagogue. He saw,
of course, that a statesman cannot oppose the
general will beyond a certain point, and may
have to humour it in small things that he may
direct it in great ones. He was obliged, as
others have been, to take up and settle questions
he deemed unimportant because they were
troubling the body politic. Now and then, in
his later days, he so far yielded to his party
advisers as to express his approval of proposals
in which his own interest was slight. But he
was ever a leader, not a follower, and erred
rather in not keeping his finger closely and
constantly upon the pulse of public opinion. In
this point, at least, one may discover in him a
likeness to Disraeli. Slow as he was in maturing
his opinions, Mr. Gladstone was liable to forget
that the minds of his followers might not be
moving along with his own, and hence his
decisions sometimes took his party as well as
the nation by surprise. But he was too self-absorbed,
too eagerly interested in the ideas that
suited his own cast of thought, to be able to
watch and gauge the tendencies of the multitude.
The three most remarkable instances in which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_419' name='page_419'></a>419</span>
his new departures startled the world were his
declarations against the Irish Church establishment
in 1867, against the Turks and the traditional
English policy of supporting them in 1876,
and in favour of Irish Home Rule in 1886, and
in none of these did any popular demand suggest
his pronouncement. It was the masses who took
their view from him, not he who took a mandate
from the masses. In each of these cases he may,
perhaps, be blamed for not having sooner perceived,
or at any rate for not having sooner announced,
the need for a change of policy. But it was very
characteristic of him not to give the full strength
of his mind to a question till he felt that it pressed
for a solution. Those who listened to his private
talk were scarcely more struck by the range of
his vision than by his unwillingness to commit
himself on matters whose decision he could
postpone. Reticence and caution were sometimes
carried too far, not merely because they
exposed him to misconstruction, but because
they withheld from his party the guidance it
needed. This was true in the three instances
just mentioned; and in the last of them it is
possible that earlier and fuller communications
might have averted the separation of some of
his former colleagues. Nor did he always
rightly divine the popular mind. His proposal
(in 1874) to extinguish the income-tax
fell completely flat, because the nation was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_420' name='page_420'></a>420</span>
becoming indifferent to that economy in public
expenditure which both parties had in the days
of Peel and Lord John Russell vied in demanding.
Cherishing his old financial ideals, Mr. Gladstone
had not marked the change. So he failed to
perceive how much the credit of his party was
suffering (after 1871) from the belief of large
sections of the people, that he was indifferent
to the interests of England outside England.
Perhaps, knowing the charge of indifference to
be groundless, he underrated the effect which the
iteration of it produced: perhaps his pride would
not let him stoop to dissipate it.</p>
<p>Though the power of reading the signs of
the times and swaying the mind of the nation
may be now more essential to an English
statesman than the skill which manages a legislature
or holds together a cabinet, that skill
counts for much, and must continue to do so
while the House of Commons remains the
governing authority of the country. A man
can hardly reach high place, and certainly cannot
retain high place, without possessing this
kind of art. Mr. Gladstone was at one time
thought to want it. In 1864, when Lord Palmerston&rsquo;s
end was approaching, and Mr. Gladstone
had shown himself the strongest man among
the Liberal ministers in the House of Commons,
people speculated about the succession
to the headship of the party; and the wiseacres
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_421' name='page_421'></a>421</span>
of the day were never tired of repeating
that Mr. Gladstone could not possibly lead the
House of Commons. He wanted tact, they said,
he was too excitable, too impulsive, too much
absorbed in his own ideas, too unversed in the
arts by which individuals are conciliated. But
when, after twenty-five years of his unquestioned
reign, the time for his own departure drew nigh,
men asked how the Liberal party in the House
of Commons would ever hold together after it
had lost a leader of such consummate capacity.
The Whig critics of 1864 had grown so accustomed
to Palmerston&rsquo;s way of handling the House
as to forget that a man might succeed by quite
different methods, and that defects, serious in
themselves, may be outweighed by transcendent
merits.</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone had the defects ascribed to
him. His impulsiveness sometimes betrayed
him into declarations which a cooler reflection
would have dissuaded. The second reading
of the Irish Home Rule Bill of 1886 might
possibly have been carried had he not been
goaded by his opponents into words which
were construed as recalling or modifying the
concessions he had announced at a meeting
of the Liberal party held just before. More
than once precious time was wasted because antagonists,
knowing his excitable temper, brought
on discussions with the sole object of annoying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_422' name='page_422'></a>422</span>
him and drawing from him some hasty deliverance.
Nor was he an adept, like Disraeli and Disraeli&rsquo;s
famous Canadian imitator, Sir John A.
Macdonald, in the management of individuals.
His aversion for the meaner side of human
nature made him refuse to play upon it. Many
of the pursuits, and most of the pleasures,
which attract ordinary men had no interest for
him, so that much of the common ground on
which men meet was closed to him. He was,
moreover, too constantly engrossed by the subjects
he loved, and by enterprises which specially
appealed to him, to have leisure for the lighter
but often vitally important devices of political
strategy. I remember hearing, soon after 1870,
how Mr. Delane, then editor of the <i>Times</i>, had
been invited to meet the Prime Minister at a
moment when the support of that newspaper
would have been specially valuable to the Liberal
Government. Instead of using the opportunity
in the way that had been intended, Mr. Gladstone
dilated during the whole time of dinner upon
the approaching exhaustion of the English coal-beds,
to the surprise of the company and the unconcealed
annoyance of the powerful guest. It
was the subject then uppermost in his mind, and
he either forgot, or disdained, to conciliate Mr.
Delane. Good nature as well as good sense
made him avoid giving offence by personal reflections
in debate, and he usually suffered fools
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_423' name='page_423'></a>423</span>
if not, like St. Paul&rsquo;s converts, gladly, yet
patiently.<a name='FNanchor_0055' id='FNanchor_0055'></a><a href='#Footnote_0055' class='fnanchor'>[64]</a> In the House of Commons he was
entirely free from airs, and, indeed, from any
assumption of superiority. The youngest member
might accost him in the lobby and be listened
to with perfect courtesy. But he had a bad
memory for faces, seldom addressed any one
outside the circle of his personal friends, and
more than once made enemies by omitting
to notice and show attention to recruits who,
having been eminent in their own towns, expected
to be made much of when they entered Parliament.
Having himself plenty of pride and comparatively
little vanity, he never realised the extent to which,
and the cheapness with which, men can be captured
and used through their vanity. Adherents were
sometimes turned into dangerous foes because
his preoccupation with graver matters dimmed his
sense of what may be done to win support by the
minor arts, such as an invitation to dinner or even a
seasonable compliment. And his mind, flexible as
it was in seizing new points of view and devising
expedients to meet new circumstances, did not
easily enter into the characters of other men.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_424' name='page_424'></a>424</span>
Ideas and causes interested him more than did
personal traits; his sympathy was keener and
stronger for the sufferings of nations or masses
of men than with the fortunes of an individual
man. With all his accessibility and kindliness,
he was at bottom chary of real friendship,
while the circle of his intimates became constantly
smaller with advancing years. So it befell that
though his popularity among the general body
of his adherents went on increasing, and the
admiration of his parliamentary followers remained
undiminished, he had in the House of Commons
few personal friends who linked him to the party
at large, and rendered to him those confidential
services which count for much in keeping all
sections in hearty accord and enabling the commander
to gauge the sentiment of his troops.</p>
<p>Of parliamentary strategy in that larger sense,
which covers familiarity with parliamentary forms
and usages, care and judgment in arranging the
business of the House, the power of seizing a
parliamentary situation and knowing how to
deal with it, the art of guiding a debate and
choosing the right moment for reserve and for
openness, for a dignified retreat, for a watchful
defence, for a sudden rattling charge upon the
enemy&mdash;of all this no one had a fuller mastery.
His recollection of precedents was unrivalled, for
it began in 1833 with the first reformed Parliament,
and it seemed as fresh for those remote
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_425' name='page_425'></a>425</span>
days as for last month. He enjoyed combat for
its own sake, not so much from inborn pugnacity,
for he was not disputatious in ordinary
conversation, as because it called out his fighting
force and stimulated his whole nature. &ldquo;I am
never nervous in reply,&rdquo; he once said, &ldquo;though I
am sometimes nervous in opening a debate.&rdquo; No
one could be more tactful or adroit when a crisis
arrived whose gravity he had foreseen. In the
summer of 1881 the House of Lords made some
amendments to the Irish Land Bill which were
deemed ruinous to the working of the measure,
and therewith to the prospects of the pacification
of Ireland. A conflict was expected which might
have strained the fabric of the constitution. The
excitement which quickly arose in Parliament
spread to the nation. Mr. Gladstone alone
remained calm and confident. He devised a
series of compromises, which he advocated in conciliatory
speeches. He so played his game that
by a few minor concessions he secured nearly all
the points he cared for, and, while sparing the
dignity of the Lords, steered his bill triumphantly
out of the breakers which had threatened to
engulf it. Very different was his ordinary demeanour
in debate when he was off his guard.
His face and gestures while he sat in the House
of Commons listening to an opponent would
express all the emotions that crossed his mind.
He would follow every sentence as a hawk follows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_426' name='page_426'></a>426</span>
the movements of a small bird, would sometimes
contradict half aloud, sometimes turn to
his next neighbour to vent his displeasure at the
groundless allegations or fallacious arguments he
was listening to, till at last, like a hunting leopard
loosed from the leash, he would spring to his
feet and deliver a passionate reply. His warmth
would often be in excess of what the occasion
required, and quite disproportioned to the importance
of his antagonist. It was in fact the
unimportance of the occasion that made him thus
yield to his feeling. As soon as he saw that
bad weather was coming, and careful seamanship
wanted, his coolness returned, his language
became measured, while passion, though it might
increase the force of his oratory, never made him
deviate a hand&rsquo;s breadth from the course he
had chosen. The Celtic heat subsided, and the
shrewd self-control of the Lowland Scot regained
command.</p>
<p>It was by oratory that Mr. Gladstone rose to
fame and power, as, indeed, by it most English
statesmen have risen, save those to whom wealth
and rank and family connections used to give a
sort of presumptive claim to high office, like the
Cavendishes and the Russells, the Bentincks and
the Cecils. And for many years, during which Mr.
Gladstone was suspected as a statesman because,
while he had ceased to be a Tory, he had not fully
become a Liberal, his eloquence was the main, one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_427' name='page_427'></a>427</span>
might almost say the sole, source of his influence.
Oratory was a power in English politics even a
century and a half ago, as the career of the
elder Pitt shows. During the last seventy years,
years which have seen the power of rank and
family connections decline, it has, although
less cultivated as a fine art, continued to be
almost essential to the highest success, and it
still brings a man quickly to the front, though it
will not keep him there should he prove to want
the other branches of statesmanlike capacity.</p>
<p>The permanent reputation of an orator depends
upon two things, the witness of contemporaries
to the impression produced upon them, and the
written or printed record of his speeches. Few
are the famous speakers who would be famous
if they were tried by this latter test alone, and
Mr. Gladstone was not one of them. It is only
by a rare combination of gifts that one who
speaks with so much force and brilliance as
to charm his listeners is also able to deliver
thoughts so valuable in words so choice that
posterity will read them as literature. Some
of the ancient orators did this; but we seldom
know how far those of their speeches which
have been preserved are the speeches which
they actually delivered. Among moderns, a few
French preachers, Edmund Burke, Macaulay, and
Daniel Webster are perhaps the only speakers
whose discourses have passed into classics and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_428' name='page_428'></a>428</span>
find new generations of readers.<a name='FNanchor_0056' id='FNanchor_0056'></a><a href='#Footnote_0056' class='fnanchor'>[65]</a> Twenty years
hence Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s will not be read, except, of
course, by historians. Indeed, they ceased to be
read even in his lifetime. They are too long,
too diffuse, too minute in their handling of details,
too elaborately qualified in their enunciation of
general principles. They contain few epigrams
and few of those weighty thoughts put into telling
phrases which the Greeks called <span class='greek' title='gn&ocirc;mai'>&gamma;&nu;&#x1FF6;&mu;&alpha;&iota;</span>. The
style, in short, is not sufficiently rich or polished
to give an enduring interest to matter whose
practical importance has vanished. The same
oblivion has overtaken all but a few of the
best speeches (or parts of speeches) of Grattan,
Sheridan, Pitt, Fox, Erskine, Canning, Plunket,
Brougham, Peel, Bright. It may, indeed, be
said&mdash;and the examples of Burke and Macaulay
show that this is no paradox&mdash;that the speakers
whom posterity most enjoys are rarely those who
most affected the audiences that listened to them.<a name='FNanchor_0057' id='FNanchor_0057'></a><a href='#Footnote_0057' class='fnanchor'>[66]</a></p>
<p>If, on the other hand, Mr. Gladstone be judged
by the impression he made on his own time, his
place will be high in the front rank. His speeches
were neither so concisely telling as Mr. Bright&rsquo;s
nor so finished in diction; but no other man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_429' name='page_429'></a>429</span>
among his contemporaries&mdash;neither Lord Derby
nor Mr. Lowe, nor Lord Beaconsfield nor Lord
Cairns, nor Bishop Wilberforce nor Bishop Magee&mdash;taken
all round, could be ranked beside him.
And he rose superior to Mr. Bright himself in
readiness, in variety of knowledge, in persuasive
ingenuity. Mr. Bright spoke seldom and required
time for preparation. Admirable in the breadth
and force with which he set forth his own position,
or denounced that of his adversaries, he was
not equally qualified for instructing nor equally
apt at persuading. Mr. Gladstone could both
instruct and persuade, could stimulate his friends
and demolish his opponents, and could do all
these things at an hour&rsquo;s notice, so vast and well
ordered was the arsenal of his mind. Pitt was
superb in an expository or argumentative speech,
but his stately periods lacked variety. Fox, incomparable
in reply, was hesitating and confused
when he had to state his case in cold blood.
Mr. Gladstone showed as much fire in winding
up a debate as skill in opening it.</p>
<p>His oratory had, indeed, two faults. It wanted
concentration, and it wanted definition. There
were too many words, and the conclusion was
sometimes left vague because the arguments had
been too nicely balanced. I once heard Mr.
Cobden say: &ldquo;I always listen to Mr. Gladstone
with pleasure and admiration, but I sometimes
have to ask myself, when he has sat down, &lsquo;What
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_430' name='page_430'></a>430</span>
after all was it that he meant, and what practical
course does he recommend?&rsquo;&rdquo; These faults
were balanced by conspicuous merits. There
was a lively imagination, which enabled him
to relieve even dull matter by pleasing figures,
together with a large command of quotations
and illustrations. There were powers of sarcasm,
powers, however, which he rarely used, preferring
the summer lightning of banter to the
thunderbolts of invective. There was admirable
lucidity and accuracy in exposition. There was
art in the disposition and marshalling of his
arguments, and finally&mdash;a gift now almost lost
in England&mdash;there was a delightful variety and
grace of appropriate gesture. But above and
beyond everything else which enthralled the
listener, there stood out four qualities. Two of
them were merits of substance&mdash;inventiveness and
elevation; two were merits of delivery&mdash;force in
the manner, expressive modulation in the voice.</p>
<p>No one showed such swift resourcefulness in
debate. His readiness, not only at catching a
point, but at making the most of it on a moment&rsquo;s
notice, was amazing. Some one would lean over
the back of the bench he sat on and show a
paper or whisper a sentence to him. Apprehending
the bearings at a glance, he would take
the bare fact and so shape and develop it, like
a potter moulding a bowl on the wheel out of
a lump of clay, that it grew into a cogent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_431' name='page_431'></a>431</span>
argument or a happy illustration under the eye of
the audience, and seemed all the more telling
because it had not been originally a part of his
case. Even in the last three years of his parliamentary
life, when his sight had so failed that he
read nothing, printed or written, except what it
was absolutely necessary to read, and when his
deafness had so increased that he did not hear
half of what was said in debate, it was sufficient for
a colleague to say into the better ear a few
words explaining how the matter at issue stood,
and he would rise to his feet and extemporise
a long and ingenious argument, or retreat with
dexterous grace from a position which the course
of the discussion or the private warning of the
Whips had shown to be untenable. Never was
he seen at a loss either to meet a new point
raised by an adversary or to make the best of
an unexpected incident. Sometimes he would
amuse himself by drawing a cheer or a contradiction
from his opponents, and would then suddenly
turn round and use this hasty expression of their
opinion as the basis for a fresh argument of his
own. Loving conflict, he loved debate, and,
so far from being confused or worried by the
strain conflict put upon him, his physical health
was strengthened and his faculties were roused
to higher efficiency by having to prepare and
deliver a great speech. He had the rare faculty
of thinking ahead while he was speaking, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_432' name='page_432'></a>432</span>
could, while pouring forth a stream of glittering
sentences, be at the same time (as one saw by
watching his eye) composing an argument to be
delivered five or ten minutes later. Once, at a
very critical moment, when he was defending a
great measure against the amendment&mdash;moved
by a nominal supporter of his own&mdash;which proved
fatal to it, a friend suddenly reminded him of
an incident in the career of the mover which might
be effectively used against him. When Mr. Gladstone
sat down after delivering an impassioned
speech, in the course of which he had several
times approached and then sheered off from the
incident, he turned round to the friend and said,
&ldquo;I was thinking all the time I was speaking
whether I could properly use against &mdash;&mdash; what
you told me, but concluded, on the whole, that
it would be too hard on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The weakness of his eloquence sprang from its
supersubtlety and superabundance. He was prone
to fine distinctions. He multiplied arguments when
it would have been better to rely upon two or
three of the strongest. And he was sometimes
so intent on refuting the particular adversaries
opposed to him, and persuading the particular
audience before him, that he forgot to address
his reasonings to the public beyond the House,
and make them equally applicable and equally
convincing to the readers of next morning.</p>
<p>As dignity is one of the rarest qualities in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_433' name='page_433'></a>433</span>
literature, so elevation is one of the rarest in
oratory. It is a quality easier to feel than to
analyse. One may call it a power of ennobling
ordinary things by showing their relation to great
things, by pouring high emotions round them,
by bringing the worthier motives of human
conduct to bear upon them, by touching them
with the light of poetry. Ambitious writers and
speakers strain after effects of this kind; but
they are effects which study and straining
cannot ensure. Vainly do most men flap their
wings in the effort to soar; if they succeed
in rising from the ground it is because some
unusually strong burst of feeling makes them
for the moment better than themselves. In
Mr. Gladstone the capacity for feeling was at
all times so strong, and the susceptibility of the
imagination so keen, that he soared without
effort. His vision seemed to take in the whole
landscape. The points actually in question
might be small, but the principles involved were
to him far-reaching. The contests of to-day
were ennobled by the effect they might have in
a still distant future. There are rhetoricians
skilful in playing by words and manner on every
chord of human nature, rhetoricians who move
you, and may even carry you away for the
moment, but whose sincerity is doubted, because
the sense of spontaneity is lacking. Mr. Gladstone
was not of these. He never seemed to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_434' name='page_434'></a>434</span>
forcing an effect or assuming a sentiment. To
listen to him was to feel convinced of his own
conviction and to be warmed by the warmth with
which he expressed it. Nor was this due to the
perfection of his rhetorical art. He really did
feel what he expressed. Sometimes, of course,
like all statesmen, he had to maintain a cause
whose weakness he perceived, as, for instance,
when it became necessary to defend the blunder
of a colleague, or a decision reached by some
Cabinet compromise which his own judgment
disapproved. But even in such cases he did
not simulate feeling, but reserved his earnestness
for those parts of the case on which it could be
honestly expended. As this was generally true
of the imaginative and emotional side of his eloquence,
so was it especially true of his unequalled
power of lifting a subject from the level on which
other speakers had treated it into the purer air
of permanent principle, perhaps even of moral
sublimity.</p>
<p>The dignity and spontaneity which marked the
substance of his speeches was no less conspicuous
in their delivery. Nothing could be more easy and
graceful than his manner on ordinary occasions,
nothing more grave and stately than it became
when he was making a ceremonial reference
to some public event or bestowing a meed of
praise on the departed. His expository discourses,
such as those with which he introduced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_435' name='page_435'></a>435</span>
a complicated bill or unfolded a financial statement,
were models of their kind, not only for
lucidity, but for the pleasant smoothness, never
lapsing into monotony, with which the stream
of speech flowed from his lips. The task was
performed so well that people thought it an
easy task till they saw how inferior were the
performances of two subsequent chancellors of
the exchequer so able in their respective
ways as Sir Stafford Northcote and Mr. Lowe.
But when an occasion arrived which quickened
men&rsquo;s pulses in the House of Commons, a place
where feeling rises as suddenly as do the waves
of a Highland loch when a squall comes rushing
down the glen, the vehemence of his feeling
found expression in the fire of his eye and the
resistless strength of his words. His utterance
did not grow swifter, nor did the key of his
voice rise, as passion raises and sharpens the
voice in most men. But the measured force with
which every sentence was launched, like a shell
hurtling through the air, the concentrated intensity
of his look, as he defied antagonists in
front and swept his glance over the ranks of his
supporters around and behind him, had a startling
and thrilling power which no other Englishman
could exert, and which no Englishman had
exerted since the days of Pitt and Fox. The
whole proud, bold, ardent nature of the man
seemed to flash out, and one almost forgot what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_436' name='page_436'></a>436</span>
the lips said in admiration of the towering
personality.</p>
<p>People who read next day the report in the
newspapers of a speech delivered on such an
occasion could not comprehend the impression
it had made on the listeners. &ldquo;What was there
in it so to stir you?&rdquo; they asked. They had not
seen the glance and the gestures; they had not
heard the vibrating voice rise to an organ peal
of triumph or sink to a whisper of entreaty. Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s voice was naturally rich and resonant.
It was a fine singing voice, and a pleasant voice
to listen to in conversation, not the less pleasant
for having a slight trace of Liverpool accent
clinging to it. But what struck one in listening
to his speeches was not so much the quality of
the vocal chords as the skill with which they were
managed. He had a gift of sympathetic expression,
of throwing his feeling into his voice,
and using its modulations to accompany and convey
every shade of meaning, like that which a
great composer exerts when he puts music to a
poem, or a great executant when he renders at
once the composer&rsquo;s and the poet&rsquo;s thought. And
just as accomplished singers or violinists enjoy
the practice of their art, so he rejoiced, perhaps
unconsciously, yet intensely, in putting forth this
faculty of expression; as appeared, indeed, from
the fact that whenever his voice failed him
(which sometimes befell in later years) his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_437' name='page_437'></a>437</span>
words came less easily, and even the chariot of
his argument seemed to drive heavily. That
the voice should so seldom have failed was
wonderful. When he had passed his seventy-fifth
year, it became sensibly inferior in volume
and depth of tone. But its variety and delicacy
remained. In April 1886, he being then seventy-seven,
it held out during a speech of nearly
four hours in length. In February 1890 it
enabled him to deliver with extraordinary effect
an eminently solemn and pathetic appeal. In
March 1894 those who listened to it the last time
it was heard in Parliament&mdash;they were comparatively
few, for the secret of his impending
resignation had been well kept&mdash;recognised in it
all the old charm. The most striking instance I
recall of the power it could exert is to be found
in a speech made in 1883, during one of the
tiresome debates occasioned by the refusal of
the Opposition and of some timorous Liberals
to allow Mr. Bradlaugh to be sworn as a member
of the House of Commons. This speech produced
on those who heard it an impression
which its perusal to-day fails to explain. That
impression was chiefly due to the grave and
reverent tone in which he delivered some
sentences stating the view that it is not our
belief in the bare existence of a Deity, but the
realising of him as being a Providence ruling
the world, that has moral value and significance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_438' name='page_438'></a>438</span>
for us. And it was due in particular to the solemn
dignity with which he declaimed six lines of
Lucretius, setting forth the Epicurean view that
the gods do not concern themselves with human
affairs. There were perhaps not twenty men
in the House of Commons who could follow the
sense of the lines so as to appreciate their bearing
on his argument. But these sonorous hexameters&mdash;hexameters
that seemed to have lived on
through nineteen centuries to find their application
from the lips of an orator to-day&mdash;the
sense of remoteness in the strange language and
the far-off heathen origin, the deep and moving
note in the speaker&rsquo;s voice, thrilled the imagination
of the audience and held it spellbound, lifting
for a moment the whole subject of debate
into a region far above party conflicts. Spoken
by any one else, the passage culminating in
these Lucretian lines might have produced
little effect. It was the voice and manner,
above all the voice, with its marvellous modulations,
that made the speech majestic.</p>
<p>Yet one must not forget to add that with him,
as with some other famous statesmen, the impression
made by a speech was in a measure due
to the admiring curiosity and wonder which his
personality inspired. He was so much the most
interesting human being in the House of Commons
that, when he withdrew, many members
said that the place had lost half its attraction for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_439' name='page_439'></a>439</span>
them, and that the chamber looked empty because
he was not in it. Plenty of able men remained.
But even the ablest seemed ordinary when compared
with the figure that had vanished, a figure
in whom were combined, as in no other man of
his time, an unrivalled experience, an extraordinary
activity and versatility of intellect, a fervid imagination,
and an indomitable will.</p>
<p>Though Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s oratory was a main
source of his power, both in Parliament and over
the people, the effort of detractors to represent
him as a mere rhetorician will seem absurd
to the historian who reviews his whole career.
The rhetorician adorns and popularises the ideas
which have originated with others; he advocates
policies which others have devised; he follows
and expresses the sentiments which already prevail
in his party. Mr. Gladstone was himself a
source of new ideas and new policies; he evoked
new sentiments or turned old sentiments into
new channels. Neither was he, as some alleged,
primarily a destroyer. His conservative instincts
were strong; he cherished ancient custom.
When it became necessary to clear away an
institution he sought to put something else in
its place. He was a constructive statesman not
less conspicuously than were Pitt, Canning, and
Peel. Whether he was a philosophic statesman,
basing his action on large views obtained by
thought and study, philosophic in the sense in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_440' name='page_440'></a>440</span>
which we apply the epithet to Pericles, Machiavelli,
Turgot, Burke, Jefferson, Hamilton, Stein&mdash;if
one class can be made to include persons
otherwise so dissimilar&mdash;may perhaps be doubted.
There are few instances in history of men who
have been great thinkers and also great legislators
or administrators, because the two kinds of
capacity almost exclude one another. As experts
declare that a man who should try to operate on
the Stock Exchange in reliance upon a profound
knowledge of the inner springs of European
politics and the financial resources of the great
States, would ruin himself before his perfectly
correct calculations had time to come true, so a
practical statesman, though he cannot know too
much, or look too far ahead, must beware of trusting
his own forecasts, must remember that he
has to deal with the next few months or years,
and to persuade persons who cannot be expected
to share or even to understand his views of the
future. The habit of meditating on underlying
truths, the tendency to play the long game, are
almost certain to spoil a man for dealing effectively
with the present. He will not be a sufficiently
vigilant observer; he will be out of sympathy
with the notions of the average man; his arguments
will go over the head of his audience.
No English prime minister has looked at politics
with the eye of a philosopher. But Mr. Gladstone,
if hardly to be called a thinker, showed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_441' name='page_441'></a>441</span>
higher constructive power than any one else
has done since Peel. Were the memory of his
oratorical triumphs to pass completely away, he
would deserve to be remembered in respect of
the mark he left upon the British statute-book and
of the changes he wrought both in the constitution
of his country and in her European policy.</p>
<p>Three groups of measures stand out as monuments
of his skill and energy. The first of these
three includes the financial reforms embodied in
a series of fourteen budgets between the years
1853 and 1882, the most famous of which were
the budgets of 1853 and 1860. In the former he
continued the work begun by Peel by reducing
and simplifying the customs duties. Deficiencies
in revenue were supplied by the enactment of
less oppressive imposts, and particularly by resettling
the income-tax, and by the introduction
of a succession duty on real estate. The preparation
and passing of this very technical and
intricate Succession Duty Act was a most
laborious enterprise, of which Mr. Gladstone
used to speak as the severest mental strain he
had ever undergone:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><span class='greek' title='Kartist&ecirc;n d&ecirc; t&ecirc;n ge mach&ecirc;n phato dymenai andr&ocirc;n'>&kappa;&alpha;&rho;&tau;&#x3AF;&sigma;&tau;&eta;&nu; &delta;&#x1F74; &tau;&#x3AE;&nu; &gamma;&epsilon; &mu;&#x3AC;&chi;&eta;&nu; &phi;&#x3AC;&tau;&omicron; &delta;&#x3CD;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&alpha;&iota; &#x1F00;&nu;&delta;&rho;&#x1FF6;&nu;.</span><a name='FNanchor_0058' id='FNanchor_0058'></a><a href='#Footnote_0058' class='fnanchor'>[67]</a></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>The budget of 1860, among other changes,
abolished the paper duty, a boon to the press
which was resisted by the House of Lords.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_442' name='page_442'></a>442</span>
They threw out the measure, but in the following
year Mr. Gladstone forced them to submit.
His achievements in the field of finance equal, if
they do not surpass, those of Peel, and are not
tarnished, as in the case of Pitt, by the recollection
of a burden of debts incurred. To no
minister can be ascribed so large a share in
promoting the commercial and industrial prosperity
of modern England, and in the reduction
of her national debt to the figure at which it
stood when it began to rise again in 1900.</p>
<p>The second group includes the parliamentary
reform bills of 1866 and 1884 and the Redistribution
Bill of 1885. The first of these was defeated
in the House of Commons, but it led to the
passing next year, by Mr. Disraeli, of a more
sweeping measure. Taken together, these statutes
have turned Britain into a democratic country,
changing the character of her government almost
as profoundly as did the Reform Act of 1832.</p>
<p>The third group consists of a series of Irish
measures, beginning with the Church Disestablishment
Act of 1869, and including the Land
Act of 1870, the University Education Bill of
1873 (defeated in the House of Commons), the
Land Act of 1881, and the Home Rule bills of
1886 and 1893. All these were in a special
manner Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s handiwork, prepared as
well as brought in and advocated by him. All
were highly complicated, and of one, the Land
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_443' name='page_443'></a>443</span>
Act of 1881, which it took three months to carry
through the House of Commons, it was said
that so great was its intricacy that only three
men understood it&mdash;Mr. Gladstone himself, his
Attorney-General for Ireland, and Mr. T. M.
Healy. In preparing a bill no man could be
more painstaking. He settled and laid down the
principles himself; and when he came to work them
out with the draughtsman and the officials who had
special knowledge of the subject, he insisted on
knowing what their effect would be in every
particular. Indeed, he loved work for its own
sake, in this respect unlike Mr. Bright, who once
said to me with a smile, when asked as to his
methods of working, that he had never done any
work all his life. The value of this mastery of
details was seen when a bill came to be debated
in Committee. It was impossible to catch Mr.
Gladstone tripping on a point of fact, or unprepared
with a reply to the arguments of an
opponent. He seemed to revel in the toil of
mastering a tangle of technical details.</p>
<p>It is long since England, in this respect not
favoured by her parliamentary system, has produced
a great foreign minister, nor has that title
been claimed for Mr. Gladstone. But he showed
on several occasions both his independence of
tradition and his faith in broad principles as fit to
be applied in international relations; and his
action in that field, though felt only at intervals,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_444' name='page_444'></a>444</span>
has left abiding results in European history. In
1851, he being then still a Tory, his pamphlet
denouncing the cruelties of the Bourbon government
of Naples, and the sympathy he subsequently
avowed with the national movement in
Italy, gave that movement a new standing in
Europe by powerfully recommending it to English
opinion. In 1870 the prompt action of his ministry
in arranging a treaty for the neutrality of Belgium
on the outbreak of the war between France and
Germany, averted the risk that Belgium might
be drawn into the strife. In 1871, by concluding
the treaty of Washington, which provided for the
settlement by arbitration of the <i>Alabama</i> claims,
he not only set a precedent full of promise for
the future, but delivered England from what
would have been, in case of her being at war with
any European power, a danger fatal to her ocean
commerce. And, in 1876, his onslaught upon the
Turks, after the Bulgarian massacres, roused an
intense feeling in England, turning the current of
opinion so decisively that Disraeli&rsquo;s ministry were
forced to leave the Sultan to his fate, and thus
became a cause of the ultimate deliverance of
Bulgaria, Eastern Rumelia, Bosnia, and Thessaly
from Mussulman tyranny. Few English statesmen
have equally earned the gratitude of the
oppressed.</p>
<p>Nothing lay nearer to his heart than the protection
of the Christians of the East. His sense
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_445' name='page_445'></a>445</span>
of personal duty to them was partly due to the
feeling that the Crimean War had prolonged the
rule of the Turk, and had thus imposed a special
responsibility on Britain, and on the members
of Lord Aberdeen&rsquo;s cabinet which drifted into
that war. Twenty years after the agitation of
1876, and when he had finally retired from
Parliament and political life, the massacres perpetrated
by the Sultan on his Armenian subjects
brought him once more into the field, and
his last speech in public (delivered at Liverpool
in the autumn of 1896) was a powerful argument
in favour of British intervention to rescue the
Eastern Christians. In the following spring he
followed this up by a pamphlet on behalf of the
freedom of Crete. In neither of these two cases
did success crown his efforts, for the Government,
commanding a large majority in Parliament,
pursued the course upon which it had already
entered. Poignant regrets were expressed
that Mr. Gladstone was no longer able to take
effective action in the cause of humanity; yet
it was a consolation to be assured that age and
infirmity had not dulled his sympathies with
that cause.</p>
<p>That he was right in 1876-78 in the view he
took of the line of conduct England should adopt
towards the Turks has been now virtually
admitted even by his opponents. That he was
also right in 1896, when urging action to protect
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_446' name='page_446'></a>446</span>
the Eastern Christians, will probably be admitted
ten years hence, when the facts of the case and
the nature of the opportunity that existed for
taking prompt action without the risk of a
European war have become better known. In
both cases it was not merely religious sympathy,
but also a far-sighted view of policy that governed
his judgment. He held that the faults of Turkish
rule are incurable, and that the Powers of Western
and Central Europe ought to aim at protecting
the subject nationalities and by degrees extending
self-government to them, so that they may
grow into states, and in time be able to restore
prosperity to regions ruined by long misgovernment,
while constituting an effective barrier to
the advance of Russia. The jealousies of the
Powers throw obstacles in the way of this policy,
but it is a safe policy for England, and offers the
best hope for the peoples of the East.</p>
<p>The facts just noted prove that he possessed
and exerted a capacity for initiative in foreign as
well as in domestic affairs. In the Neapolitan case,
in the <i>Alabama</i> case, in the Bulgarian case, he
acted from his own convictions, with no previous
suggestion of encouragement from his party; and
in the last-mentioned instance he took a course
which did not at the moment promise any political
gain, and which seemed to the English political
world so novel and even startling that no ordinary
statesman would have ventured on it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_447' name='page_447'></a>447</span></div>
<p>His courage was indeed one of the most
striking parts of the man.<a name='FNanchor_0059' id='FNanchor_0059'></a><a href='#Footnote_0059' class='fnanchor'>[68]</a> It was not the rashness
of an impetuous nature, for, impetuous as
he was when stirred by some sudden excitement,
he showed an Ulyssean caution whenever he took a
deliberate survey of the conditions that surrounded
him. It was the proud self-confidence of a strong
character, which was willing to risk fame and
fortune in pursuing a course it had once resolved
upon; a character which had faith in its own
conclusions, and in the success of a cause consecrated
by principle; a character which obstacles
did not affright, but rather roused to a higher
combative energy. Few English statesmen have
done anything so bold as was Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
declaration for Irish Home Rule in 1886. He
took not only his political power but the fame
and credit of his whole past life in his hand when
he set out on this new journey at seventy-seven
years of age; for it was quite possible that the
great bulk of his party might refuse to follow
him, and he be left exposed to derision as the
chief of an insignificant group. As it happened,
the bulk of the party did follow him, though
many of the most influential refused to do so.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_448' name='page_448'></a>448</span>
But neither he nor any one else could have foretold
this when his intentions were first announced.</p>
<p>We may now, before passing away from the
public side of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s career, return
for a moment to the opposite views of his
character which were indicated some pages back.
He was accused of sophistry, of unwisdom, of
want of patriotism, of lust for power. Though it
is difficult to sift these charges without discussing
the conduct which gave rise to them, a task impossible
here, each of them must be briefly examined.</p>
<p>The first charge is the most plausible. His ingenuity
in discovering arguments and stating fine
verbal distinctions, his subtlety in discriminating
between views or courses apparently similar, were
excessive, and invited misconstruction. He had a
tendency to persuade himself, quite unconsciously,
that the course he desired to take was a course
which the public interest required. His acuteness
soon found reasons for that course; the warmth
of his emotions enforced the reasons. It was a
dangerous tendency, but it does not impeach his
honesty of purpose, for the influence which his
predilections unconsciously exerted upon his
judgment appeared also in his theological and
literary inquiries. I can recall no instance in
which he wilfully misstated a fact, or simulated a
feeling, or used an argument which he knew to be
unsound. He did not, as does the sophist, attempt
&ldquo;to make the worse appear the better reason.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_449' name='page_449'></a>449</span></div>
<p>His wisdom will be differently judged by
those who condemn or approve the chief acts of
his policy. But it deserves to be noted that all
the legislation he passed, even the measures
which, like the Irish Church Disestablishment
Bill, exposed him to angry attacks at the time,
have now been approved by the all but unanimous
judgment of Englishmen.<a name='FNanchor_0060' id='FNanchor_0060'></a><a href='#Footnote_0060' class='fnanchor'>[69]</a> The same
may be said of two acts which brought much
invective upon him&mdash;his settlement of the
<i>Alabama</i> claims, one of the wisest strokes of
foreign policy ever accomplished by a British
minister, and his protest against a support of the
Turks in and after 1876. I pass by Irish Home
Rule, because the wisdom of the course he took
must be tested by results that are yet unborn,
as I pass by his Egyptian policy in 1882-85,
because it cannot be fairly judged till the facts
have been fully made public. He may be open
to blame for his participation in the Crimean War,
for his mistaken view of the American Civil War,
for his neglect of the Transvaal question when
he took office in 1880, and for his omission during
his earlier career to recognise the gravity of Irish
disaffection and to study its causes. I have heard
him lament that he had not twenty years earlier
given the same attention to that abiding source of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_450' name='page_450'></a>450</span>
the difficulties of England which he gave from 1866
onwards. If in these instances he erred, it must be
remembered that he erred in company with nine-tenths
of British statesmen in both political parties.</p>
<p>Their admiration did not prevent his friends
from noting tendencies which sometimes led him
to miscalculate the forces he had to deal with.
Being, like the younger Pitt, extremely sanguine,
he was prone to underrate difficulties. Hopefulness
is a splendid quality. It is both the child
and the parent of faith. Without it neither Mr.
Pitt nor Mr. Gladstone could have done what they
did. But it disposes its possessor not sufficiently
to allow for the dulness or the prejudice of others.
So too the intensity of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s own feeling
made him fail to realise how many of his fellow-countrymen
did not know of, or were not shocked
by, acts of cruelty and injustice which had roused
his indignation. If his hatred of ostentation
suffered him to perceive that a nation, however
well assured of the reality of its power
and influence in the world, may also desire that
this power and influence should be asserted and
proclaimed to other nations, he refused to humour
that desire. He had a contempt for what is
called &ldquo;playing to the gallery,&rdquo; with a deep sense
of the danger of stimulating the passions which
lead to aggression and war. To national honour,
as he conceived it, national righteousness was vital.
His spirit was that of Lowell&rsquo;s lines&mdash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_451' name='page_451'></a>451</span></div>

</td></tr></table>
<p>It was this attitude that brought on him the
charge of wanting patriotism, a charge first, I think,
insinuated at the time of the <i>Alabama</i> arbitration,
renewed when in 1876 he was accused of befriending
Russia and neglecting &ldquo;British interests,&rdquo; and
sedulously repeated thereafter, although in those
two instances the result had proved him right.
There was this much to give a kind of colour to
the charge, that he had scrupulously, perhaps too
scrupulously, refrained from extolling the material
power of England, preferring to insist upon her
responsibilities; that he was known to regret the
constant increase of naval and military expenditure,
and that he had several times taken a course
which honour and prudence seemed to him to
recommend, but which had offended the patriots
of the music-halls. But it was an unjust charge,
for no man had a warmer pride in England, a
higher sense of her greatness and her mission.</p>
<p>Was he too fond of power? Like other
strong men, he enjoyed it.<a name='FNanchor_0061' id='FNanchor_0061'></a><a href='#Footnote_0061' class='fnanchor'>[70]</a> That to secure it
he ever either adopted or renounced an opinion,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_452' name='page_452'></a>452</span>
those who understood and watched the workings
of his mind could not believe. He was not only
too conscientious, but too proud to forego any of
his convictions, and there were not a few occasions
when he took a course which considerations of
personal interest would have forbidden. He did
not love office, feeling himself happier without its
cares, and when he accepted it did so, I think, in
the belief that there was work to be done which
it was laid upon him individually to do. His
changes sprang naturally from the development of
his own ideas or (as in the case of his Irish policy)
from the teaching of facts. He sometimes so far
yielded to his colleagues as to sanction steps which
he thought not the best, and may in this have
sometimes erred; yet compromises are unavoidable,
for no Cabinet could be kept together if its
members did not now and then, in matters not
essential, yield to one another. When all the facts
of his life come to be known, instances may be disclosed
in which he was the victim of his own casuistry
or of his deference to Peel&rsquo;s maxim that a
minister should not avow a change of view until
the time has come to give effect to it. But it will
also be made clear that he strove to obey his conscience,
that he acted with an ever-present sense
of his responsibility to the Almighty, and that he
was animated by an unselfish enthusiasm for
humanity, enlightenment, and freedom.</p>
<p>Whether he was a good judge of men was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_453' name='page_453'></a>453</span>
a question much discussed among his friends.
With all his astuteness, he was in some ways
curiously simple; with all his caution, he was by
nature unsuspicious, disposed to treat all men as
honest till they gave him strong reasons for thinking
otherwise. Those who professed sympathy
with his views and aims sometimes succeeded in
inspiring more confidence than they deserved.
But where this perturbing influence was absent
he showed plenty of insight, and would pass
shrewd judgments on the politicians around him,
permitting neither their behaviour towards himself
nor his opinion of their moral character to
affect his estimate of their talents. In making
appointments in the Civil Service, or in the
Established Church, he rose to a far higher
standard of public duty than Palmerston or
Disraeli had reached or cared to reach, taking
great pains to find the fittest men, and giving
little weight to political considerations.<a name='FNanchor_0062' id='FNanchor_0062'></a><a href='#Footnote_0062' class='fnanchor'>[71]</a></p>
<p>His public demeanour, and especially his
excitability and vehemence of speech, made
people attribute to him an overbearing disposition
and an irritable temper. In private one did
not find these faults. Masterful he certainly
was, both in speech and in action. His ardent
manner, the intensity of his look, the dialectical
vigour with which he pressed an argument, were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_454' name='page_454'></a>454</span>
apt to awe people who knew him but slightly,
and make them abandon resistance. A gifted
though somewhat erratic politician of long bygone
days told me how he once fared when he had risen
in the House of Commons to censure some act of
his leader. &ldquo;I had not gone on three minutes
when Gladstone turned round and gazed at me
so that I had to sit down in the middle of a
sentence. I could not help it. There was no
standing his eye.&rdquo; But he neither meant nor
wished to beat down his opponents by mere
authority. One who knew him as few people
did observed to me, &ldquo;When you are arguing
with Mr. Gladstone, you must never let him
think he has convinced you unless you are really
convinced. Persist in repeating your view, and
if you are unable to cope with him in skill of
fence, say bluntly that for all his ingenuity and
authority you think he is wrong, and you retain
your own opinion. If he respects you as a man
who knows something of the subject, he will be
impressed by your opinion, and it will afterwards
have due weight with him.&rdquo; In his own Cabinet
he was willing to listen patiently to everybody&rsquo;s
views, and, indeed, in the judgment of some of
his colleagues, was not, at least in his later
years, sufficiently strenuous in asserting and
holding to his own. It is no secret that some
of the most important decisions of the ministry
of 1880-85 were taken against his judgment,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_455' name='page_455'></a>455</span>
though, when they had been adopted, he was, of
course, bound to defend them in Parliament as if
they had received his individual approval. Nor,
though tenacious, did he bear malice against those
who had baffled him. He would exert his full
force to get his own way, but if he could not
get it, accepted the position with good temper.<a name='FNanchor_0063' id='FNanchor_0063'></a><a href='#Footnote_0063' class='fnanchor'>[72]</a>
He was too proud to be vindictive, too completely
master of himself to be betrayed into
angry words. Impatient he might sometimes
be under a nervous strain, but never rude or
rough. It was less easy to determine whether
he was overmindful of injuries, but those who
had watched him most closely held that mere
opposition or even insult did not leave a permanent
sting, and that the only thing he could
not forget or forgive was faithlessness. Himself
a model of loyalty to his colleagues, he followed
his favourite poet in consigning the <i>traditori</i>
to the lowest pit, although, like all statesmen,
he often found himself obliged to work with
those whom he distrusted.</p>
<p>He was less sensitive than Peel, as appeared
from his attitude toward his two chief opponents.
Disraeli&rsquo;s attacks did not seem to gall him,
perhaps because, although he recognised the
ability and admired the courage of his adversary,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_456' name='page_456'></a>456</span>
he did not respect Disraeli&rsquo;s character, remembering
his behaviour to Peel, and thinking him
habitually untruthful. Yet he never attacked
Disraeli personally. There was another of his
opponents of whom he entertained a specially
unfavourable opinion, but no one could have
told from his speeches what that opinion was.
Against Lord Salisbury, his chief antagonist
from 1881 onwards, he showed no resentment,
though Lord Salisbury had more than once
spoken discourteously of him. In 1890 he remarked
to me <i>apropos</i> of some attack, &ldquo;I have
never felt angry at what Salisbury has said about
me. His mother was very kind to me when I
was quite a young man, and I remember Salisbury
as a little fellow in a red frock rolling about
on the ottoman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That his temper was naturally hot, no one
who looked at him could doubt. But he had it
in such tight control, and it was so free from
anything acrid or malignant, that it had become
a good temper, worthy of a fine nature. However
vehement his expressions, they did not wound
or humiliate, and those younger men who had to
deal with him were not afraid of a sharp answer or
an impatient repulse. He was cast in too large
a mould to have the pettiness of ruffled vanity
or to abuse his predominance by treating any
one as an inferior. His manners were the
manners of the old time, easy but stately. Like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_457' name='page_457'></a>457</span>
his oratory, they were in what Matthew Arnold
used to call the grand style; and the contrast in
this respect between him and some of those
who crossed swords with him in literary or
theological controversy was apparent. His intellectual
generosity was a part of the same
largeness of nature. He cordially acknowledged
his indebtedness to those who helped him in
any piece of work, received their suggestions
candidly, even when opposed to his own preconceived
notions, did not hesitate to confess a
mistake. Those who know the abundance of
their resources, and have conquered fame, can
doubtless afford to be generous. Julius C&aelig;sar
was, and George Washington, and so, in a
different sphere, were Isaac Newton and Charles
Darwin. But the instances to the contrary are
so numerous that one may say of magnanimity
that it is among the rarest as well as the finest
ornaments of character.</p>
<p>The essential dignity of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s nature
was never better seen than during the last few
years of his life, after he had finally retired
(in 1894) from public life. He indulged in no
vain regrets, nor was there any foundation for
the rumours, so often circulated, that he thought
of re-entering the arena of strife. He spoke
with no bitterness of those who had opposed,
and sometimes foiled, him in the past. He
gave vent to no criticisms of those who from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_458' name='page_458'></a>458</span>
time to time filled the place that had been
his in the government of the country or the
leadership of his party. Although his opinion
on current questions was frequently solicited, he
scarcely ever allowed it to be known, lest it
should embarrass his successors in the leadership
of the party, and never himself addressed the
nation, except (as already mentioned) on behalf
of what he deemed a sacred cause, altogether
above party&mdash;the discharge by Britain of her
duty to the victims of the Turk. As soon as an
operation for cataract had enabled him to resume
his habit of working for seven hours a day, he
devoted himself with his old ardour to the preparation
of an edition of Bishop Butler&rsquo;s works,
resumed his multifarious reading, planned (as he
told me in 1896) a treatise on the Olympian religion,
and filled up the interstices of his working-time
with studies on Homer which he had been
previously unable to complete. No trace of the
moroseness of old age appeared in his manners or
his conversation, nor did he, though profoundly
grieved at some of the events which he witnessed,
and owning himself disappointed at the slow advance
made by a cause dear to him, appear less
hopeful than in earlier days of the general progress
of the world, or less confident in the beneficent
power of freedom to promote the happiness
of his country. The stately simplicity which had
always charmed those who saw him in private,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_459' name='page_459'></a>459</span>
seemed more beautiful than ever in this quiet
evening of a long and sultry day. His intellectual
powers were unimpaired, his thirst for knowledge
undiminished. But a placid stillness had
fallen upon him and his household; and in seeing
the tide of his life begin slowly to ebb, one
thought of the lines of his illustrious contemporary
and friend:&mdash;</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'><span class='indent6'>&nbsp;</span>Such a tide as moving seems asleep,<br />

</td></tr></table>
<p>Adding to his grace of manner a memory
of extraordinary strength and quickness and an
amazing vivacity and variety of mental force, any
one can understand how fascinating Mr. Gladstone
was in society. He enjoyed it to the last,
talking as earnestly and joyously at eighty-seven as
he had done at twenty on every topic that came
up, and exerting himself with equal zest whether
his interlocutor was an archbishop or a youthful
curate. Though his party used to think that he
overvalued the political influence of the great
families, allotting them rather more than their share
of honours and appointments, no one was personally
more free from that taint of snobbishness
which is frequently charged upon Englishmen.
He gave the best he had to everybody alike,
paying to men of learning and letters a respect
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_460' name='page_460'></a>460</span>
which in England they seldom receive from the
magnates who lead society. And although he
was scrupulously observant of the rules of precedence
and conventions of social life, it was
easy to see that neither rank nor wealth had
that importance in his eyes which the latter
nowadays commands. Dispensing titles and
decorations with a liberal hand, his pride always
refused such so-called honours for himself.</p>
<p>It was often said of him that he lacked
humour; but this was only so far true that he
was apt to throw into small matters more force
and moral earnestness than were needed, and to
honour with a refutation opponents whom a
little light sarcasm would have better reduced
to their insignificance.<a name='FNanchor_0064' id='FNanchor_0064'></a><a href='#Footnote_0064' class='fnanchor'>[73]</a> In private he was wont
both to tell and to enjoy good stories; while
in Parliament, though his tone was generally
earnest, he could display such effective powers
of banter and ridicule as to make people
wonder why they were so rarely put forth.
Much of what passes in London for humour
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_461' name='page_461'></a>461</span>
is mere cynicism, and he hated cynicism so
heartily as to dislike even humour when it
had a cynical flavour. Wit he enjoyed, but
did not produce. The turn of his mind was
not to brevity, point, and condensation. He
sometimes struck off a telling phrase, but seldom
polished an epigram. His conversation was
luminous rather than sparkling; you were
interested and instructed while you listened,
but it was not so much the phrases as the
general effect that dwelt in your memory.
An acute observer once said to me that Mr.
Gladstone showed in argument a knack of hitting
the nail not quite on the head. The criticism
was so far just that he was less certain to go
straight to the vital issue in a controversy than
one expected from his force and keenness.</p>
<p>After the death of Thomas Carlyle he was
probably the best talker in London, and a talker
in one respect more agreeable than either Carlyle
or Macaulay, inasmuch as he was no less ready
to listen than to speak, and never wearied the
dinner-table by a monologue. His simplicity,
his spontaneity, his geniality and courtesy, as well
as the fund of knowledge and of personal recollections
at his command, made him so popular
in society that his opponents used to say it was
dangerous to meet him, because one might be
forced to leave off hating him. He was, perhaps,
too prone to go on talking upon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_462' name='page_462'></a>462</span>
subject which filled his mind at the moment;
nor was it easy to divert his attention to something
else which others might deem more important.<a name='FNanchor_0065' id='FNanchor_0065'></a><a href='#Footnote_0065' class='fnanchor'>[74]</a>
Those who stayed with him in the
same country house sometimes complained that
the perpetual display of force and eagerness
tired them, as one tires of watching the rush
of Niagara. His guests, however, did not feel
this, for his own home life was quiet and smooth.
He read and wrote a good many hours daily, but
never sat up late, almost always slept soundly,
never seemed oppressed or driven to strain
his strength. With all his impetuosity, he
was regular, systematic, and deliberate in his
habits and ways of doing business. A swift
reader and a surprisingly swift writer, he was
always occupied, and was skilful in using even
the scraps and fragments of his time. No pressure
of work made him fussy, nor could any one
remember to have seen him in a hurry.</p>
<p>The best proof of his swiftness, industry, and
skill in economising time is supplied by the
quantity of his literary work, which, considering
the abstruse nature of the subjects to which
much of it is related, would have been creditable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_463' name='page_463'></a>463</span>
to the diligence of a German professor
sitting alone in his study. The merits of the
work have been disputed. Mankind are slow to
credit the same person with eminence in various
fields. When they read the prose of a great
poet, they try it by severer tests than would be
applied to other writers. When a painter has
won credit by his landscapes or his cattle pieces,
he is seldom encouraged to venture into other
lines. So Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s reputation as an
orator stood in his own light when he appeared
as an author. He was read by thousands
who would not have looked at the article
or book had it borne some other name; but he
was judged by the standard, not of his finest
printed speeches, for his speeches were seldom
models of composition, but rather by the impression
which his finest speeches made on those
who heard them. Since his warmest admirers
could not claim for him as a writer of prose any
such pre-eminence as belonged to him as a
speaker, it followed that his written work was
not duly appreciated. Had he been a writer and
nothing else, he would have been eminent and
powerful by his pen.</p>
<p>He might, however, have failed to secure a place
in the front rank. His style was forcible, copious,
rich with various knowledge, warm with the
ardour of his temperament. But it suffered from
an inborn tendency to exuberance which the long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_464' name='page_464'></a>464</span>
practice of oratory had confirmed. It was diffuse,
apt to pursue a topic into details, when these might
have been left to the reader&rsquo;s own reflection. It
was redundant, employing more words than were
needed to convey the substance. It was unchastened,
indulging too freely in tropes and
metaphors, in quotations and adapted phrases
even when the quotation added nothing to the
sense, but was suggested merely by some association
in his own mind. Thus it seldom reached
a high level of purity and grace, and though one
might excuse the faults as natural to the work
of a swift and busy man, they were sufficient
to reduce the pleasure to be derived from the
form and dress of his thoughts. Nevertheless
there are not a few passages of rare merit,
both in the books and in the articles, among
which may be cited (not as exceptionally good,
but as typical of his strong points) the striking
picture of his own youthful feeling toward
the Church of England contained in the <i>Chapter
of Autobiography</i>, and the refined criticism of
<i>Robert Elsmere</i>, published in 1888. Almost
the last thing he wrote, a pamphlet on the
Greek and Cretan question, published in the
spring of 1897, has the force and cogency of his
best days. Two things were never wanting to
him: vigour of expression and an admirable
command of appropriate words.</p>
<p>His writings fall into three classes: political,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_465' name='page_465'></a>465</span>
theological, and literary&mdash;the last chiefly consisting
of his books and articles upon Homer
and the Homeric question. All the political
writings, except the books on <i>The State in its
Relations to the Church</i> and <i>Church Principles
considered in their Results</i>, belong to the class
of occasional literature, being pamphlets or
articles produced with a view to some current
crisis or controversy. They are valuable
chiefly as proceeding from one who bore a
leading part in the affairs they relate to, and
as embodying vividly the opinions and aspirations
of the moment, less frequently in respect
of permanent lessons of political wisdom, such
as one finds in Machiavelli or Tocqueville or
Edmund Burke. Like Pitt and Peel, Mr. Gladstone
had a mind which, whatever its original
tendencies, had come to be rather practical than
meditative. He was fond of generalisations and
principles, but they were always directly related
to the questions that came before him in actual
politics; and the number of weighty maxims or
illuminative suggestions to be found in his writings
and speeches is small in proportion to the
sustained vigour they display. Even Disraeli,
though his views were often fanciful and his
epigrams often forced, gives us more frequently
a brilliant (if only half true) historical <i>aper&ccedil;u</i>, or
throws a flash of light into some corner of human
character. Of the theological essays, which are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_466' name='page_466'></a>466</span>
mainly apologetic and concerned with the authenticity
and authority of Scripture, it is enough to
say that they were the work of an accomplished
amateur, who had been too busy to follow the progress
of critical inquiry. His Homeric treatises,
the most elaborate piece of work that proceeded
from Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s pen, are in one sense worthless,
in another sense admirable. Those parts of
them which deal with early Greek mythology,
genealogy, and religion, and, in a less degree, the
theories about Homeric geography and the use
of Homeric epithets, have been condemned by
the unanimous voice of scholars as fantastic.
The premises are assumed without sufficient investigation,
while the reasonings are fine-drawn
and flimsy. Extraordinary ingenuity is shown
in piling up a lofty fabric, but the foundation is
of sand, and the edifice has hardly a solid wall
or beam in it. A conjecture is treated as a fact;
then an inference, possible but not certain, is
drawn from this conjecture; a second possible
inference is based upon the first; and we are
made to forget that the probability of this second
is at most only half the probability of the first.
So the process goes on; and when the superstructure
is complete, the reader is provoked
to perceive how much dialectical skill has been
wasted upon a series of hypotheses which a breath
of common-sense criticism dissipates. If one is
asked to explain the weakness in this particular
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_467' name='page_467'></a>467</span>
department of a mind otherwise so strong, the
answer would seem to be that the element of
fancifulness in Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s intellect, and his
tendency to mistake mere argumentation for
verification, were checked in practical politics by
constant intercourse with friends and colleagues
as well as by the need of convincing visible
audiences, while in theological or historical inquiries
his ingenuity roamed with fatal freedom
over wide plains where no obstacles checked
its course. Something may also be due to the
fact that his philosophical and historical education
was received at a time when the modern
critical spirit and the canons it recognises had
scarcely begun to assert themselves at Oxford.
Similar defects may be discerned in other eminent
writers of his own and the preceding generation
of Oxford men, defects from which persons of
inferior power in later days might be free. In
some of these writers, and particularly in Cardinal
Newman, the contrast between dialectical acumen,
coupled with surpassing rhetorical skill, and the
vitiation of the argument by a want of the critical
faculty, is scarcely less striking; and the example
of that illustrious man suggests that the dominance
of the theological view of literary and
historical problems, a dominance evident in Mr.
Gladstone, counts for something in producing the
phenomenon.</p>
<p>With these defects, Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Homeric
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_468' name='page_468'></a>468</span>
work had the merit of being based on a full
and thorough knowledge of the Homeric text.
He had seen, at a time when few people in
England had seen it, that the Homeric poems
are an historical source of the highest value, a
treasure-house of data for the study of early
Greek life and thought, an authority all the more
trustworthy because an unconscious authority,
addressing not posterity but contemporaries.
This mastery of the matter contained in the
poems enabled him to present valuable pictures
of the political and social life of Homeric Greece,
while the interspersed literary criticisms are often
subtle and suggestive, erring, when they do err,
chiefly through the over-earnestness of his mind.
He often takes the poet too seriously; reading
an ethical purpose into descriptive or dramatic
touches which are merely descriptive or dramatic.
Passages whose moral tendency offends him are
reprobated as later insertions with a na&iuml;vet&eacute; which
forgets the character of a primitive age. But he
has for his author not only that sympathy which is
the best basis for criticism, but a justness of poetic
taste which the learned and painstaking German
commentator frequently wants. That Mr. Gladstone
was a sound scholar in that narrower sense of
the word which denotes a grammatical and literary
command of Greek and Latin, goes without saying.
Men of his generation kept a closer hold
upon the ancient classics than we do to-day; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_469' name='page_469'></a>469</span>
his habit of reading Greek for the sake of his
Homeric studies, and Latin for the sake of his
theological, made this familiarity more than
usually thorough. Like most Etonians, he loved
and knew the poets by preference. Dante was
his favourite poet, perhaps because Dante is the
most theological and ethical of the great poets,
and because the tongue and the memories of Italy
had a peculiar attraction for him. He used to say
that he found Dante&rsquo;s thought incomparably inspiring,
but hard to follow, it was so high and so
abstract. Theology claimed a place beside poetry;
history came next, though he did not study it
systematically. It seemed odd that he was sometimes
at fault in the constitutional antiquities of
England; but this subject was, until the day of
Dr. Stubbs, pre-eminently a Whig subject, and
Mr. Gladstone never was a Whig, never learned
to think upon the lines of the great Whigs of
former days. His historical knowledge was not
exceptionally wide, but it was generally accurate
in matters of fact, however fanciful he might be
in reasoning from the facts, however wild his
conjectures in the prehistoric region. In metaphysics
strictly so called his reading did not go
far beyond those companions of his youth, Aristotle
and Bishop Butler; and philosophical speculation
interested him only so far as it bore on
Christian doctrine. Keen as was his interest
in theology and in history, it is not certain that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_470' name='page_470'></a>470</span>
he would have produced work of permanent
value in either sphere even had his life been
wholly devoted to study. His mind seemed to
need to be steadied, his ingenuity restrained,
by having to deal with concrete matter for a
practical end. Neither, in spite of his eminence
as a financier and an advocate of free
trade, did he show much taste for economic
studies. On practical topics, such as the working
of protective tariffs, the abuse of charitable
endowments, the development of fruit-culture in
England, the duty of liberal giving by the rich,
the utility of thrift among the poor, his remarks
were full of point, clearness, and good sense, but
he seldom launched out into the wider sea of
economic theory. He took a first-class in mathematics
at Oxford, at the same time as his first
in classics, but did not pursue the subject in
later life. Regarding the sciences of experiment
and observation, he seemed to feel as little
curiosity as any educated man who notes the
enormous part they play in the modern world
can feel. Sayings of his have been quoted which
show that he imperfectly comprehended the character
of the evidence they rely upon and of the
methods they employ. On one occasion he
horrified a dinner-table of younger friends by
refusing to accept some of the most certain conclusions
of modern geology. No doubt he belonged,
as Lord Derby (the Prime Minister) once said of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_471' name='page_471'></a>471</span>
himself, to a pre-scientific age. Perhaps he was
unconsciously biassed by the notion that such
sciences as geology and biology, for instance, were
being used by some students to sap the foundations
of revealed religion. But I can recall
no sign of disposition to dissuade free inquiry
either into those among the sciences of nature
which have been supposed to touch theology, or
into the date, authorship, and authority of the
books of the Bible. He had faith not only in his
creed, but in God as a God of truth, and in the
power of research to elicit truth.</p>
<p>General propositions are dangerous, yet it
seems safe to observe that great men have
seldom been obscurantists or persecutors. Either
the sympathy with intellectual effort which is
natural to a powerful intellect, or the sense that
free inquiry, though it may be checked by repression
for a certain time or within a certain
area, will ultimately have its course, dissuades
them from that attempt to dam up the stream of
thought which smaller minds regard as the obvious
expedient for saving souls or institutions.</p>
<p>It ought to be added, for this was a remarkable
feature of his character, that he had the deepest
reverence for the great poets and philosophers,
placing the career of the statesman on a far lower
plane than that of those who rule the world by
their thoughts enshrined in literature. He expressed
in a striking letter to Tennyson&rsquo;s eldest son
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_472' name='page_472'></a>472</span>
his sense of the immense superiority of the poet&rsquo;s
life and work. Once, in the lobby of the House
of Commons, seeing his countenance saddened by
the troubles of Ireland, I told him, in order to
divert his thoughts, how some one had recently
discovered that Dante had in his last years been
appointed at Ravenna to a lectureship which
raised him above the pinch of want. Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s
face lit up at once, and he said, &ldquo;How
strange it is to think that these great souls whose
words are a beacon-light to all the generations
that have come after them, should have had
cares and anxieties to vex them in their daily
life, just like the rest of us common mortals.&rdquo;
The phrase reminded me that a few days before
I had heard Mr. Darwin, in dwelling upon the
pleasure a visit paid by Mr. Gladstone had
given him, say, &ldquo;And he talked just as if he had
been an ordinary person like one of ourselves.&rdquo;
The two great men were alike unconscious of
their greatness.</p>
<p>It was an unspeakable benefit to Mr. Gladstone
that his love of letters and learning enabled him
to find in the pursuit of knowledge a relief from
anxieties and a solace under disappointments.
Without some such relief his fiery and restless
spirit would have worn itself out. He lived two
lives&mdash;the life of the statesman and the life of the
student, and passed swiftly from the one to the
other, dismissing when he sat down to his books
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_473' name='page_473'></a>473</span>
all the cares of politics. But he led a third
life also, the secret life of the soul. Religion
was of all things that which had the strongest
hold upon his thoughts and feelings. Nothing
but his father&rsquo;s opposition prevented him from
becoming a clergyman when he quitted the University.
Never thereafter did he cease to take
the warmest interest in everything that affected
the Christian Church. He lost his seat for Oxford
University by the votes of the country clergy,
who formed the bulk of the constituency. He incurred
the displeasure of four-fifths of the Anglican
communion by disestablishing the Protestant
Episcopal Church in Ireland, and from 1868 to the
end of his life found nearly all the clerical force
of the English establishment arrayed against him,
while his warmest support came from the Nonconformists
of England and the Presbyterians of
Scotland. Yet nothing affected his devotion to
the Church in which he had been brought up, nor
to the body of Anglo-Catholic doctrine he had
imbibed as an undergraduate. After an attack
of influenza which had left him very weak in the
spring of 1891, he endangered his life by attending
a meeting on behalf of the Colonial Bishoprics
Fund, for which he had spoken fifty years before.
His theological opinions tinged his views upon
political subjects. They filled him with dislike of
the legalisation of marriage with a deceased wife&rsquo;s
sister; they made him a vehement opponent of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_474' name='page_474'></a>474</span>
the bill which established the English Divorce
Court in 1857, and a watchfully hostile critic of
all divorce legislation in America afterwards.
Some of his friends traced to the same cause his
less than adequate appreciation of German literature
(though he admired Goethe and Schiller) and
even his political coldness towards Prussia and
afterwards towards the German Empire. He
could not forget that Germany had been the
fountain of rationalism, while German Evangelical
Protestantism was more schismatic and farther
removed from the medi&aelig;val Catholic Church than
it pleased him to deem the Church of England to
be. He had an exceedingly high sense of the
duty of purity of life and of the sanctity of
domestic relations, and his rigid ideas of decorum
inspired so much awe that it used to be said to a
person who had told an anecdote with ever so
slight a tinge of impropriety, &ldquo;How many thousands
of pounds would you take to tell that to
Gladstone?&rdquo; When living in the country, it was
his practice to attend daily morning service in
the parish church, and on Sunday to read in
church the lessons for the day; and he rarely, if
ever, transgressed his rule against Sunday labour.
Religious feeling, coupled with a system of firm
dogmatic beliefs, was the mainspring of his life, a
guiding light in perplexities, a source of strength
in adverse fortune, a consolation in sorrow, a
beacon of hope beyond the failures and disappointments
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_475' name='page_475'></a>475</span>
of this present world. He did not
make what is commonly called a profession of
religion, and talked little about it in general
society, although always ready to plunge into a
magazine controversy when Christianity was
assailed. But those who knew him best knew
that he was always referring current questions to,
and trying his own conduct by, a religious
standard. He believed in the efficacy of prayer,
and sought through prayer for strength and for
direction in the affairs of state. He was a remarkable
example of the coexistence together
with a Christian virtue of a quality which
Catholic theologians treat as a mortal sin. He
was an exceedingly proud man, yet an exceedingly
humble Christian. With a high regard for
his own dignity and a sensitiveness to any imputation
on his honour, he was deeply conscious of
his imperfections in the eye of God, realising the
weakness and sinfulness of human nature with
a medi&aelig;val intensity. The language of self-depreciation
he was wont to use, sometimes
deemed unreal, expressed his genuine sense of
the contrast between the religious ideal he set
up and his own attainment. And the tolerance
which he extended to those who attacked him
or who had (as he thought) behaved ill in public
life was largely due to this pervading sense of the
frailty of human character, and of the inextricable
mixture in conduct of good and bad motives.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_476' name='page_476'></a>476</span>
&ldquo;It is always best to take the charitable view,&rdquo;
he once observed when I had quoted to him the
saying of Dean Church that Mark Pattison had
painted himself too black in his autobiography&mdash;&ldquo;always
best,&rdquo; adding, with grim emphasis,
&ldquo;especially in politics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this indulgent view, more evident in his
later years, and the more remarkable because
his expressions were often too vehement, there
was nothing of the cynical &ldquo;man of the world&rdquo;
acceptance of a low standard as the only possible
standard, for his moral earnestness was as fervent
at eighty-eight as it had been at thirty, and he
retained a simplicity and an unwillingness to suspect
sinister motives, singular in one who had
seen so much. Although accessible and frank in
the ordinary converse of society, he was in reality
a reserved man; not shy, stiff, and externally
cold, like Peel, nor always standing on a pedestal
of dignity, like the younger Pitt, but revealing
his deepest thoughts only to a few intimate
friends, and treating others with a courteous
kindliness which, though it put them at their
ease, did not encourage them to approach nearer.
Thus, while he was admired by the mass of his
followers, and beloved by the small inner group
of family friends, the majority of his colleagues,
official subordinates, and political or ecclesiastical
associates, would have hesitated to give him any of
friendship&rsquo;s confidences. Though quick to mark
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_477' name='page_477'></a>477</span>
and acknowledge good service, or to offer to a junior
an opportunity of distinction, many deemed him
too much occupied with his own thoughts to
show interest in his disciples, or to bestow those
counsels which a young man prizes from his
chief. But for the warmth of his devotion to a
few early friends and the reverence he paid to
their memory, a reverence touchingly shown in
the article on Arthur Hallam which he published
near the end of his own life, sixty-five years after
Hallam&rsquo;s death, there might have seemed to be
a measure of truth in the judgment that he cared
less for men than for ideas and causes. Those,
however, who marked the pang which the departure
to the Roman Church of his friend Hope
Scott caused him, those who in later days noted
the enthusiasm with which he would speak of
Lord Althorp, his opponent, and of Lord Aberdeen,
his chief, dwelling upon the truthfulness and
uprightness of the former and the amiability of
the latter, knew that the impression of detachment
he gave wronged the sensibility of his own
heart. Of how few who have lived for more than
sixty years in the full sight of their countrymen,
and have been as party leaders exposed to angry
and sometimes spiteful criticism, can it be said
that there stands on record against them no
malignant word and no vindictive act! This
was due not perhaps entirely to natural sweetness
of disposition, but rather to self-control
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_478' name='page_478'></a>478</span>
and to a certain largeness of soul which would
not condescend to anything mean or petty.
Pride, though it may be a sin, is to most of us a
useful, to some an indispensable, buttress of virtue.
Nor should it be forgotten that the perfectly happy
life which he led at home, cared for in everything
by a devoted wife, kept far from him those domestic
troubles which have soured the temper and embittered
the judgments of not a few famous men.
Reviewing his whole career, and summing up the
concurrent impressions and recollections of those
who knew him best, this dignity is the feature
which dwells most in the mind, as the outline of
some majestic Alp thrills one from afar when all
the lesser beauties of glen and wood, of crag and
glacier, have faded in the distance. As elevation
was the note of his oratory, so was magnanimity
the note of his character.</p>
<p>The Greek maxim that no one can be called
happy till his life is closed must, in the case of
statesmen, be extended to warn us from the
attempt to fix a man&rsquo;s place in history till a
generation has arisen to whom he is a mere
name, not a familiar figure to be loved or
hated. Few reputations made in politics so far
retain their lustre that curiosity continues to
play round the person when those who can remember
him living have departed. Dante has
in immortal stanzas contrasted the fame of Provenzano
Salvani that sounded through all Tuscany
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_479' name='page_479'></a>479</span>
while he lived with the faint whispers of his name
heard in his own Siena forty years after his death.<a name='FNanchor_0066' id='FNanchor_0066'></a><a href='#Footnote_0066' class='fnanchor'>[75]</a>
So out of all the men who have held a foremost
place in English public life in the nineteenth
century there are but six or seven&mdash;Pitt, Fox,
Wellington, Peel, Disraeli, possibly Canning, or
O&rsquo;Connell, or Melbourne&mdash;whose names are to-day
upon our lips. The great poet or the great
artist lives as long as his books or his pictures;
the statesman, like the singer or the actor,
begins to be forgotten so soon as his voice is
still, unless he has so dominated the men of
his own time, and made himself a part of his
country&rsquo;s history, that his personal character
is indissolubly linked to the events the course
of which he helped to determine. Tried by
this test, Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s fame seems destined
to endure. His eloquence will soon become
merely a tradition, for his printed speeches do not
preserve its charm. If some of his books continue
to be read, it will be rather because they are his
than in respect of any permanent contribution they
have made to knowledge. The wisdom of his
policy, foreign and domestic, will have to be judged,
not only by the consequences we see, but also by
other consequences still hidden in the future.
Yet among his acts there are some with which
history cannot fail to concern herself, and which
will keep fresh the memory of their author&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_480' name='page_480'></a>480</span>
energy and courage. Whoever follows the annals
of England during the memorable years from 1843
to 1894 will meet his name on almost every page,
will feel how great must have been the force of an
intellect that could so interpenetrate the story of
its time, and will seek to know something of
the dauntless figure that rose always conspicuous
above the struggling throng.</p>
<p>There is a passage in the <i>Odyssey</i> where the
seer Theoclymenus says, in describing a vision
of death: &ldquo;The sun has perished out of heaven.&rdquo;
To Englishmen, Mr. Gladstone had been like a
sun which, sinking slowly, had grown larger as he
sank, and filled the sky with radiance even while
he trembled on the verge of the horizon. There
were men of ability and men of renown, but there
was no one comparable to him in fame and power
and honour. When he departed the light seemed
to have died out of the sky.</p>

<p>That historical interest he did feel deeply. One might almost say
of him that he was a Christian because he was a Jew, for Christianity was
to him the proper development of the ancient religion of Israel. &ldquo;The
Jews,&rdquo; he observes in the <i>Life of Lord George Bentinck</i>, &ldquo;represent the
Semitic principle, all that is most spiritual in our nature.... It is deplorable
that several millions of Jews still persist in believing only a part of
their religion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though it has been maintained that in the Dark and Middle Ages a
considerable number of Gentiles found their way into Jewish communities
and became Judaised.</p>
<p>The high average of intellectual power among the Jews need not be
attributed to purity of race; it is sufficiently explained by their history.
Nor is it clear that where two of the more advanced races are mixed by
intermarriage, the product is inferior to either of the parent stocks. On
the contrary, such a mixture, <i>e.g.</i> of Teutonic and Slavonic blood, or of
Celtic and Teutonic, gives a result at least equal in capacity to either of
the pure-blooded races which have been so commingled.</p>

<p>He had an intellectual arrogance, which made him dislike what
may be called the Radical conception of human equality. In the <i>Life
of Lord George Bentinck</i> he remarks, &ldquo;The Jews are a living and the
most striking evidence of the falsity of that pernicious doctrine of modern
times, the natural equality of man.... All the tendencies of the Jewish
race are conservative. Their bias is to religion, property, and natural
aristocracy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On one occasion he went so far as to deny that he had asked Peel for
office, relying on the fact that the letter which contained the request was
marked &ldquo;private,&rdquo; so that Peel could not use it to disprove his statement
(<i>Letters of Sir Robert Peel</i>, by C. S. Parker, vol. ii. p. 486; vol.
iii. pp. 347, 348).</p>

<p>In the <i>Life of Lord George Bentinck</i> (written shortly after Peel&rsquo;s
death), Disraeli, after dilating upon the loyalty which the Tory aristocracy
had displayed towards Peel, observes, &ldquo;An aristocracy hesitates before it
yields its confidence, but it never does so grudgingly.... In political
connections the social feeling mingles with the principle of honour which
governs gentlemen.... Such a following is usually cordial and faithful.
An aristocracy is rather apt to exaggerate the qualities and magnify the
importance of a plebeian leader.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When J. S. Mill was a candidate for Westminster in 1868, Stanley
published a letter announcing his support, partly out of personal respect
for Mill, partly because it gave him an opportunity of expressing an
opinion on the Irish Church question, and of reprobating the charge of
atheism which had been brought against Mill.</p>

<p>As I have referred to the American Civil War, it is worth adding
that there were no places in England where the varying fortunes of that
tremendous struggle were followed with a more intense interest than in
Oxford and Cambridge, and none in which so large a proportion of the
educated class sympathised with the cause of the North. Mr. Goldwin
Smith led the section which took that view, and which included three-fourths
of the best talent in Oxford. Among the younger men Green was
the most conspicuous for his ardour on behalf of the principles of human
equality and freedom. He followed and watched every move in the
military game. No Massachusetts Abolitionist welcomed the fall of
Vicksburg with a keener joy. He used to say that the whole future of
humanity was involved in the triumph of the Federal arms.</p>

Cairns, great though he was, never won personal popularity even with his

<p>A clergyman of his diocese had once, under the greatest provocation,
knocked down a person who had insulted him, and the bishop wrote
him a letter of reproof pointing out (among other things) that, exposed as
the Church of England was to much criticism on all hands, her ministers
ought to be very careful in their demeanour. The offender replied by
saying, &ldquo;I must regretfully admit that being grossly insulted, and forgetting
in the heat of the moment the critical position of the Church of
England, I did knock the man down, etc.&rdquo; Fraser, delighted with this
turning of the tables on himself, told me the anecdote with great glee, and
invited the clergyman to stay with him not long afterwards.</p>

<p>He was himself aware that this caused displeasure. In his latest
Charge, delivered some months before his death, he said: &ldquo;I am
charged, amongst other grievous sins, with that of thinking not unkindly,
and speaking not unfavourably, of Dissenters. I don&rsquo;t profess to love
dissent, but I have received innumerable kindnesses from Dissenters.
Why should I abuse them? Why should I call them hard names?
Remembering how Nonconformity was made&mdash;no doubt sometimes by
self-will and pride and prejudice and ignorance, but far more often by the
Church&rsquo;s supineness, neglect, and intolerance in days long since gone by,
of which we have not yet paid the full penalty&mdash;though, as I have said,
I love not the thing, I cannot speak harshly of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The scholars of Trinity were then (1843) all High Churchmen,
and never dined in hall on Fridays. Fourteen years later there was not a
single High Churchman among them. Ten or fifteen years afterwards
Anglo-Catholic sentiment was again strong. Freeman said that his revulsion
against Tractarianism began from a conversation with one of his
fellow-scholars, who had remarked that it was a pity there had been a
flaw in the consecration of some Swedish bishops in the sixteenth century,
for this had imperilled the salvation of all Swedes since that time. He
was startled, and began to reconsider his position.</p>

<p>Having had about the same time a brush with George Anthony
Denison (Archdeacon of Taunton), and a less friendly passage of arms with
James Anthony Froude, he wrote to me in 1870: &ldquo;I am greater than
Cicero, who was smiter of one Antonius. I venture to think that I have
whopped the whole <i>Gens Antonia</i>&mdash;first Anthony pure and simple, which
is Trollope; secondly, James Anthony, whom I believe myself to have
smitten, as Cnut did Eadric swi&eth;e rihtlice, in the matter of St. Hugh;
thirdly, George Anthony, with whom I fought again last Tuesday, carrying
at our Education Board a resolution in favour of Forster&rsquo;s bill.&rdquo; Trollope
and he became warm friends. Froude he heartily disliked, not, I think,
on any personal grounds, but because he thought Froude indifferent to
truth, and was incensed by the defence of Henry VIII.&rsquo;s crimes.</p>
<p>It may be added that Freeman, much as he detested Henry VIII., used
to observe that Henry had a sort of legal conscience, because he always
wished his murders to be done by Act of Parliament, and that the earlier
and better part of Henry&rsquo;s reign ought not to be forgotten. He was fond of
quoting the euphemism with which an old Oxford professor of ecclesiastical
history concluded his account of the sovereign whom, in respect of his relation
to the Church of England, it seemed proper to handle gently: &ldquo;The
later years of this great monarch were clouded by domestic troubles.&rdquo;</p>

him how he was getting on. &ldquo;Excellently,&rdquo; said Lowe; &ldquo;five men
plucked already, and the sixth very shaky.&rdquo; Another tale, not likely to
have been invented, relates that when he and several members of the
then Liberal Ministry were staying in Dublin with the Lord Lieutenant,
and had taken an excursion into the Wicklow hills, they found themselves
one afternoon obliged to wait for half an hour at a railway station. To
pass the time, Lowe forthwith engaged in a dispute about the charge with
the car-drivers who had brought them, a dispute which soon became hot
and noisy, to the delight of Lowe, but to the horror of the old Lord
Chancellor, who was one of the party.</p>

<p>One of his most intimate friends has, I think, said that &ldquo;he never
knew what it was to be bored.&rdquo; Fortunate, indeed, would he have been
had this been so; but that one who had watched him long and closely
should make the statement shows how gently bores fared at his hands.</p>
<p>I recollect his once remarking on the capacity for boring possessed by
a gentleman who had been introduced and had talked for some fifteen
minutes to him; but his own manner through the conversation had betrayed
no impatience.</p>

<p>His physical courage was no less evident than his moral. For two
or three years his life was threatened, and policemen were told off to
guard him wherever he went. He disliked this protection so much
(though the Home Office thought it necessary) that he used to escape from
the House of Commons by a little-frequented exit, give the policemen the
slip, and stroll home to his residence along the Thames Embankment in
the small hours of the morning. Fear was not in his nature.</p>

<p>The late Protestant Episcopal Primate of Ireland said that Disestablishment
had proved a blessing to his Church; and this would seem
to be now the general view of Irish Protestants.</p>

<p>His abdication of leadership in 1875 was meant to be final, though
when the urgency of Eastern affairs had drawn him back into strife, the
old ardour revived, and he resumed the place of Prime Minister in 1880.
It has been often said that he would have done better to retire from public
life in 1880, or in 1885, yet the most striking proofs both of his courage
and of his physical energy were given in the latest part of his career.</p>

<div class='footnote'><a name='Footnote_0062' id='Footnote_0062'></a><a href='#FNanchor_0062'><span class='label'>[71]</span></a>

<p>His respect and regard for Mr. Bright were entirely unaffected by the
fact that Mr. Bright&rsquo;s opposition to the Home Rule Bill of 1886 had been
the chief cause of its defeat.</p>

<p>Usually over-anxious to vindicate his own consistency, he showed on
one occasion a capacity for recognising the humorous side of a position
into which he had been brought. In a debate which arose in 1891
frequent references had been made to a former speech in which he had
pronounced a highly-coloured panegyric upon the Church of England in
Wales, the disestablishment of which he had subsequently become willing
to support. He replied, &ldquo;Many references have been made to a former
speech of mine on this subject, and I am not prepared to deny that in that
speech, when closely scrutinised, there may appear to be present some
element of exaggeration.&rdquo; The House dissolved in laughter, and no
further reference was made to the old speech.</p>

<p>His Oxford contemporary and friend, the late Mr. Milnes Gaskell, told
me that when Mr. Gladstone was undergoing his <i>viva voce</i> examination for
his degree, the examiner, satisfied with the candidate&rsquo;s answers on a particular
matter, said, &ldquo;And now, Mr. Gladstone, we will leave that part
of the subject.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the examinee, &ldquo;we will, if you please, not
leave it yet.&rdquo; Whereupon he proceeded to pour forth a further flood of
knowledge and disquisition.</p>
